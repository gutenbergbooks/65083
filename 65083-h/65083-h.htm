  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>America has to-day no problem more perplexing and
disquieting than that of the proper and permanent relations
between the white and the colored races. Although
it concerns most vitally the twenty millions of Caucasians
and the eight millions of Negroes in eleven States of the
South, still it is a national problem, because whatever
affects one part of our national organism concerns the
whole of it. Although this question has been considered
from almost every conceivable standpoint, few have turned
to the laws of the States and of the Nation to see how
they bear upon it. It was with the hope of gaining new
light on the subject from this source that I undertook the
present investigation.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have examined the Constitutions, statutes, and judicial
decisions of the United States and of the States and
Territories between 1865 and the present to find the laws
that have made any distinctions between persons on the
basis of race. Reference has been made to some extent
to laws in force before 1865, but only as the background
of later legislation and decision. In order to make this
study comparative as well as special, the writer has abandoned
his original plan of confining it to the Southern
States and laws applicable only to Negroes, and has extended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>it to include the whole United States and all
the races.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately after the Negro became a free man in
1865, the Federal Government undertook, by a series of
constitutional amendments and statutory enactments, to
secure to him all the rights and privileges of an American
citizen. My effort has been to ascertain how far this attempt
has been successful. The inquiry has been: After
forty-five years of freedom from physical bondage, how
much does the Negro lack of being, in truth, a full-fledged
American citizen? What limitations upon him are allowed
or imposed by law because he is a Negro?</p>

<p class='c007'>This is not meant, however, to be a legal treatise.
Although the sources are, in the main, constitutions, statutes,
and court reports, an effort has been made to state
the principles in an untechnical manner. Knowing that
copious citations are usually irksome to those who read for
general information, I have relegated all notes to the ends
of the chapters for the benefit of the more curious reader
who often finds them the most profitable part of a book.
There he will find citations of authorities for practically
every important statement made.</p>

<p class='c007'>All the chapters, except the last two, were published
serially in <cite>The American Law Review</cite>/cite> during the year
1909. The substance of the chapter on “Separation of
Races in Public Conveyances” was published also in <cite>The
American Political Science Review</cite> for May, 1909.</p>

<p class='c007'>I wish that I could make public acknowledgment of
my indebtedness to all who have helped me in the preparation
of this volume. Hundreds of public officials in the
South—mayors of cities, clerks of courts, attorneys-general,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>superintendents of public instruction, etc.—have responded
generously to my requests for information. I am
thankful to Mr. John H. Arnold, Librarian of the Harvard
Law School, for access to the stacks of that library,
without which privilege my work would have been greatly
delayed, and to his assistants for their uniform courtesy
while I was making such constant demands upon them.
I am under especial obligation to Professor Albert Bushnell
Hart, of Harvard University, for his direction and
assistance in my examination of the sources and his valuable
advice while I have been preparing the material for
publication in this form; also to Mr. Charles E. Grinnell,
former Editor of <cite>The American Law Review</cite>, for
his encouragement and suggestions during the preparation
of the articles for his magazine. Lastly, I would express
my gratitude to Mr. Charles Vernon Imlay, of the New
York Bar, the value of whose painstaking help in the revision
of the manuscript of this book is truly inestimable.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c011'>WHAT IS A RACE DISTINCTION IN LAW?</h3>

<p class='c012'>A race distinction in the law is a requirement imposed
by statute, constitutional enactment, or judicial decision,
prescribing for a person of one race a rule of conduct
different from that prescribed for a person of another race.
If, for instance, a Negro is required to attend one public
school, a Mongolian another, and a Caucasian a still different
one, a race distinction is created, because the person
must regulate his action accordingly as he belongs to
one or another race. Or, if a person, upon entering a
street car, is required by ordinance or statute to take a seat
in the front part of the car if he is a Caucasian, but in
the rear if he is a Negro, this rule is a race distinction
recognized by law. Again, a race distinction is made by
the law when intermarriage between Negroes and Caucasians
is prohibited.</p>

<p class='c007'>Distinctions in law have been made on grounds other
than race. Thus, in those States in which men may vote
by satisfying the prescribed requirements, but in which
women may not vote under any circumstances, the law
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>creates a distinction on the basis of sex. Laws forbidding
persons under seven years of age from testifying in
court and laws exempting from a poll tax persons under
twenty-one years of age give rise to age distinctions.
Other instances might be cited, but only race distinctions
have a place here.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>DISTINCTIONS AND DISCRIMINATIONS CONTRASTED</h3>

<p class='c012'>It is important, at the outset, to distinguish clearly
between race <em>distinctions</em> and race <em>discriminations</em>; more
so, because these words are often used synonymously, especially
when the Negro is discussed. A distinction between
the Caucasian and the Negro, when recognized and
enforced by the law, has been interpreted as a discrimination
against the latter. Negroes have recognized that
they are the weaker of the two races numerically, except
in the Black Belt of the South, and intellectually the less
developed. Knowing that the various race distinctions
have emanated almost entirely from white constitution-makers,
legislators, and judges, they regard these distinctions
as expressions of the aversion on the part of the
Caucasian to association with the Negro. Naturally,
therefore, they have resented race distinctions upon the
belief and, in many instances, upon the experience that
they are equivalent to race discriminations.</p>

<p class='c007'>In fact, there is an essential difference between race
distinctions and race discriminations. North Carolina, for
example, has a law that white and Negro children shall
not attend the same schools, but that separate schools shall
be maintained. If the terms for all the public schools
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>in the State are equal in length, if the teaching force is
equal in numbers and ability, if the school buildings are
equal in convenience, accommodations, and appointments,
a race distinction exists but not a discrimination. Identity
of accommodation is not essential to avoid the charge
of discrimination. If there are in a particular school district
twice as many white children as there are Negro children,
the school building for the former should be twice
as large as that for the latter. The course of study need
not be the same. If scientific investigation and experience
show that in the education of the Negro child emphasis
should be placed on one course of study, and in the education
of the white child, on another; it is not a discrimination
to emphasize industrial training in the Negro school, if
that is better suited to the needs of the Negro pupil, and
classics in the white school if the latter course is more
profitable to the white child. There is no discrimination
so long as there is equality of opportunity, and this
equality may often be attained only by a difference in
methods.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, if the term of the Negro school
is four months, and that of the white, eight; if the teachers
in the Negro schools are underpaid and inadequately
or wrongly trained, and the teachers of the white schools
are well paid and well trained; if Negro children are
housed in dilapidated, uncomfortable, and unsanitary
buildings, and white children have new, comfortable, and
sanitary buildings; if courses of study for Negro children
are selected in a haphazard fashion without any regard
to their peculiar needs, and a curriculum is carefully
adapted to the needs of white children; if such conditions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>exist under the law, race distinctions exist which
are at the same time discriminations against Negroes.
Where the tables are turned and Negro children are accorded
better educational advantages than white, the discriminations
are against Caucasians.</p>

<p class='c007'>A law of Virginia requires white and Negro passengers
to occupy separate coaches on railroad trains. If the
coaches for both races are equally clean, equally comfortable,
and equally well appointed; if both races are
accorded equally courteous service by the employees of the
railroad; if, in short, all the facilities for travel are equal
for both races, race distinctions exist but not race discriminations.
The extent of accommodations need not be identical.
The railroad company, for instance, need furnish
only the space requisite for the accommodation of each
race. If, however, the white passengers are admitted to
clean, well-lighted, well-ventilated coaches and Negroes,
to foul, unclean, uncomfortable coaches; if white coaches
are well-policed, while Negro passengers are subjected to
the insults of disorderly persons; if, in other words, the
Negro passenger does not receive as good service for his
fare as the white, a discrimination against the Negro is
made under the guise of a legal distinction.</p>

<p class='c007'>In like manner, one might consider each of the race
distinctions recognized in the law and show how it may
be applied so as not to work a discrimination against either
race and, as easily, how it may be used to work an injustice
to the weaker race. A race distinction connotes a difference
and nothing more. A discrimination necessarily implies
partiality and favoritism.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>LEGAL AND ACTUAL DISTINCTIONS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>There is a difference between actual race distinctions—those
practiced every day without the sanction of law—and
legal race distinctions—those either sanctioned or
required by statutes or ordinances. Law is crystallized
custom. Race distinctions now recognized by law were
habitually practiced long before they crystallized into
statutes. Thus, actual separation of races on railroad
coaches—if not in separate coaches, certainly in separate
seats or portions of the coach—obtained long before the
“Jim Crow” laws came into existence. Moreover, miscegenation
was punished before the legislature made it
a crime. Some race distinctions practiced to-day will
probably be sanctioned by statute in the future; others will
persist as customs. In some Southern cities, for instance,
there are steam laundries which will not accept Negro
patronage. Everywhere in the South and in many places
in other sections, there are separate churches for the races.
It is practically a universal custom among the white people
in the South never to address a Negro as “Mister” or
“Mistress.” This custom obtains to some extent elsewhere.
Thus, in a recent case before a justice of the peace in Delaware
in which the parties were Negroes, one of them
insisted upon speaking of another Negro as “Mister.”
The justice forbade him so to do, and, upon his persisting,
fined him for contempt. Yet, these distinctions and many
others that might be cited are not required by law, and
some of them, if expressed in statutes, would be unconstitutional.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most race distinctions, however, are still uncrystallized.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>But these will be mentioned merely for illustration, since
the purpose here is to discuss only those distinctions which
have been expressed in constitutions, statutes, and judicial
decisions. Mr. Ray Stannard Baker in his “Following
the Colour Line,”<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a> has admirably depicted actual race relations
in the United States. He has gone in person out
upon the cotton plantations of the Lower South; into the
Negro districts of cities in the South, East, and North;
into schools, churches, and court rooms; and has described
how the Negro lives, what he does, what he thinks about
himself and about the white man, and what the white man
thinks about him. By studying the race distinctions he
describes from the other standpoint suggested—that is,
by tracing their gradual crystallization into statutes and
judicial decisions, a better understanding may be had of
race distinctions in general.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>ALL RACE ELEMENTS INCLUDED</h3>

<p class='c012'>Attention will be directed not only to the Negro but
to other races in the United States—the Mongolian in
the Far West and the Indian in the Southwest. Of course,
by far the largest race element after the Caucasian is the
Negro with its 8,833,994 people of whom eighty-four and
seven-tenths per cent. are in the thirteen States of the
South. But it will be found that in those sections where
the Indians have existed or still exist in appreciable numbers
and come into association with the Caucasian—that
is, where they do not still maintain their tribal relations—race
distinctions have separated these two races. This
is equally true of the Japanese and Chinese in the Pacific
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>States. Most of the discussion will necessarily be of the
distinctions between Caucasians and Negroes, but as distinctions
applicable to Mongolians and Indians arise, they
will be mentioned to show that race consciousness is not
confined to any one section or race.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>PERIOD COVERED FROM 1865 TO PRESENT</h3>

<p class='c012'>Race distinctions have existed and have been recognized
in the law from the beginning of the settlement of
the New World, long before the thirteen colonies became
free and independent States, or before the Federal Constitution
was adopted. The first cargo of Negroes was
landed in Virginia in 1619, only twelve years after the
founding of Jamestown. In 1630, eleven years later, the
Virginia Assembly passed the following resolution:<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a>
“Hugh Davis to be soundly whipped before an assembly
of Negroes and others, for abusing himself to the dishonor
of God and the shame of Christians, by defiling his body
in lying with a Negro.” Many of the Colonies—later
States—prohibited intermarriage between Caucasians and
Negroes whether the latter were slave or free. The Colonies
and States prohibited or limited the movements of
free Negroes from one colony or State to another, prescribed
special punishment for adultery between white persons
and Negroes, forbade persons of color to carry firearms,
and in divers other ways restricted the actions of
Negroes.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not so profitable, however, at this day to study
these early distinctions, for the distinctions based on race
were then inseparably interwoven with those based on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>state of slavery. Thus, it is impossible to say whether
a law was passed to regulate a person’s actions because he
was a slave or because he was of the Negro race. Moreover,
the laws relating to race and slave distinctions prior
to 1858 were compiled by John Codman Hurd in his two-volume
work entitled “The Law of Freedom and Bondage
in the United States,” published in 1858. Any attempt
at a further treatment of the period covered by that work
would result only in a digest of a multitude of statutes,
most of which have been obsolete for many years. But
a greater reason for the futility of a discussion of race distinctions
before 1865 is that prior to that date, as it has
been so often expressed, the Negro was considered to have
no rights which the white man was bound to respect. The
Dred Scott decision<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a> in 1857 virtually held that a slave
was not a citizen or capable of becoming one, and this
dictum, unnecessary to the decision of the case, did much,
says James Bryce,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a> “to precipitate the Civil War.” If the
Negro could enjoy only licenses, claiming nothing as of
right, it is not very valuable to study the distinctions
which the master imposed upon him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The year 1865 marked the beginning of the present era
in race relations. It was in that year that the Negro became
a free man, and that the Federal Government undertook
by successive legislative enactments to secure and
guarantee to him all the rights and privileges which the
Caucasian race had so long enjoyed as its inalienable
heritage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Emancipation Proclamation of 1862, issued as
a military expedient, declared that, unless the seceding
States were back in the Union by January 1, 1863, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>slaves in those States should be emancipated. This did
not apply to the Union States, as Delaware, which still
had slaves. But immediately upon the cessation of hostilities,
Congress set to work to make emancipation general
throughout the Union and to give the Negro all the
rights of a citizen. The Thirteenth Amendment to the
Constitution, ratified December 18, 1865, abolished slavery
and involuntary servitude except as a punishment for
crime. The following April, the first Civil Rights Bill<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a>
was passed, which declared that “all persons born in the
United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding
Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens
of the United States; and such citizens, of every race
and color, without regard to any previous condition of
slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment
for crime&nbsp;... shall have the same right, in every State
and Territory in the United States, to make and enforce
contracts, to sue,&nbsp;... and to full and equal benefit of all
laws and proceedings in the security of persons and property,
as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject
to like punishments and penalties, and to none
other....”</p>

<p class='c007'>These rights were enlarged by the Fourteenth Amendment,
ratified in 1868, which provides that: “All persons
born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to
the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States
and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall
make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges
and immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall
any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property
without due process of law; nor deny to any person within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” Though
the word “Negro” is not mentioned in this Amendment
nor in any of the subsequent Federal enactments, it is not
open to dispute that the legislators had in mind primarily
the protection of the Negro.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Civil Rights
Bill of 1866 was reënacted<a id='r6' /><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a> in 1870, with the addition that
it extended to all persons within the jurisdiction of the
United States, and that it provided that all persons should
be subject to like taxes, licenses, and exactions of every
kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same year, 1870, the Fifteenth Amendment was
ratified, which declared that the right of citizens of the
United States to vote should not be denied or abridged
by the United States or by any States on account of race,
color, or previous condition of servitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Civil Rights Bill<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a> of 1875, the most sweeping of
all such legislation by Congress, declared that all persons
within the jurisdiction of the United States should be
entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations,
advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, public
conveyances on land or water, theatres, and other
places of public amusement; subject only to the conditions
and limitations established by law, and applicable
alike to citizens of every race and color, regardless of any
previous condition of servitude. It also provided that
jurors should not be excluded on account of race, color,
or previous condition of servitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>An enumeration of these Federal statutes and constitutional
amendments has been made in order to show
the efforts of Congress to secure to the Negro every civil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and political right of a full-fledged citizen of the United
States. Later they will be discussed in detail. By the
Civil Rights Bill of 1875, Congress apparently intended
to secure not only equal but identical accommodations in
all public places for Negroes and Caucasians. If one
looks only upon the surface of these several legislative
enactments, it would seem impossible to have a race distinction
recognized by law which did not violate some
Federal statute or the Federal Constitution. But the succeeding
pages will show that, under the shadow of the
statutes and the Constitution, the legislatures and courts
of the States have built up a mass of race distinctions
which the Federal courts and Congress, even if so inclined,
are impotent to attack.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>WHAT IS A NEGRO?</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'>LEGAL DEFINITION OF NEGRO</h3>

<p class='c012'>“I had not been long engaged in the study of the race
problem when I found myself face to face with a curious
and seemingly absurd question: ‘What is a Negro?’”
said Mr. Baker.<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Absurd as the question apparently is, it is one of the
most perplexing and, at times, most embarrassing that has
faced the legislators and judges.</p>

<p class='c007'>If race distinctions are to be recognized in the law, it
is essential that the races be clearly distinguished from
one another. If a statute provides that Negroes shall ride
in separate coaches and attend separate schools, it is necessary
to decide first who are included under the term
“Negroes.” It would seem that physical indicia would
be sufficient, and, in most instances, this is true. It is
never difficult to distinguish the full-blooded Negro, Indian,
or Mongolian one from the other or from the Caucasian.
But the difficulty arises in the blurring of the
color line by amalgamation. The amount of miscegenation
between the Mongolian and other races represented
in the United States is negligible; but the extent of intermixture
between the Caucasian and the Negro, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Negro and the Indian, and the Caucasian and the Indian
is appreciable, and problems arising from it are serious.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is absolutely impossible to ascertain the number of
mulattoes—that is, persons having both Caucasian and
Negro blood in their veins—in the United States. Mr.
Baker<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a> says: “I saw plenty of men and women who were
unquestionably Negroes, Negroes in every physical characteristic,
black of countenance with thick lips and kinky
hair, but I also met men and women as white as I am,
whose assertions that they were really Negroes I accepted
in defiance of the evidence of my own senses. I have seen
blue-eyed Negroes and golden-haired Negroes; one Negro
girl I met had an abundance of soft, straight, red hair.
I have seen Negroes I could not easily distinguish from
the Jewish or French types; I once talked with a man
I took at first to be a Chinaman but who told me he was
a Negro. And I have met several people, passing everywhere
for white, who, I knew, had Negro blood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A separate enumeration of mulattoes has been made
four times—in 1850, 1860, 1870, and 1890 respectively.
The census authorities themselves said that the figures
were of little value, and any attempt to distinguish Negroes
from mulattoes was abandoned in the census of 1900.
If a person is apparently white, the census enumerator will
feel a delicacy in asking him if he has Negro blood in his
veins. If the enumerator does ask the question and if
the other is honest in his answer, it is often that the latter
does not know his own ancestry. Dr. Booker T. Washington,
for instance, has said that he does not know who
his father was.<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Marital relations among Negroes during
slavery were so irregular, and illicit intercourse between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>white men and slave women was so common that the line
of ancestry of many mulattoes is hopelessly lost. But Mr.
Baker makes the rough estimate, which doubtless is substantially
correct, that 3,000,000 of the 10,000,000 (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">circa</span></i>)
Negroes are visibly mulattoes. This one third of the
total Negro population represents every degree of blood,
of color, and of physical demarcation from the fair complexion,
light hair, blue eyes, thin lips, and sharp nose
of the octoroon, who betrays scarcely a trace of his Negro
blood, to the coal-black skin, kinky hair, brown eyes, thick
lips, and flat nose of the man who has scarcely a trace of
Caucasian blood. It is this gradual sloping off from one
race into another which has made it necessary for the law
to set artificial lines.</p>

<p class='c007'>The difficulty arising from the intermixture of the
races was realized while the Negro was still a slave.
Throughout the statutes prior to 1860, one finds references
to “persons of color,” a generic phrase including
all who were not wholly Caucasian or Indian. This antebellum
nomenclature has been brought over into modern
statutes. It is surprising to find how seldom the word
“Negro” is used in the statutes and judicial decisions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some States have fixed arbitrary definitions of “persons
of color,” “Negroes,” and “mulattoes”; others, having
enacted race distinctions, have then defined whom
they intended to include in each race. This has been
done particularly in the laws prohibiting intermarriage.
The Constitution of Oklahoma<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a> provides that “wherever
in this Constitution and laws of this State, the word or
words, ‘colored,’ or ‘colored race,’ or ‘Negro,’ or ‘Negro
race,’ are used, the same shall be construed to mean, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>apply to all persons of African descent. The term ‘white’
shall include all other persons.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking up these definitions in the various States—many
of them included within broader statutes—one finds
that Alabama,<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Kentucky,<a id='r13' /><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a> Maryland,<a id='r14' /><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a> Mississippi,<a id='r15' /><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a> North
Carolina,<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a> Tennessee,<a id='r17' /><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a> and Texas<a id='r18' /><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a> define as a person of
color one who is descended from a Negro to the third
generation inclusive, though one ancestor in each generation
may have been white. The Code Committee of
Alabama of 1903 substituted “fifth” for “third,” so that
at present in that State one is a person of color who has
had any Negro blood in his ancestry in five generations.<a id='r19' /><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a>
The laws of Florida,<a id='r20' /><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a> Georgia,<a id='r21' /><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a> Indiana,<a id='r22' /><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a> Missouri,<a id='r23' /><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a>
and South Carolina<a id='r24' /><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a> declare that one is a person of color
who has as much as one-eighth Negro blood: the laws of
Nebraska<a id='r25' /><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a> and Oregon<a id='r26' /><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a> say that one must have as much
as one-fourth Negro blood in order to be classed with that
race. Virginia<a id='r27' /><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a> and Michigan apparently draw the line
in a similar way. In Virginia, a marriage between a white
man and a woman who is of less than one-fourth Negro
blood, “if it be but one drop less,” is legal. A woman
whose father was white, and whose mother’s father was
white, and whose great-grandmother was of a brown complexion,
is not a Negro in the sense of the statute.<a id='r28' /><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a> In
1866, the court of Michigan, under a law limiting the suffrage
to “white male citizens,” held that all persons
should be considered white who had less than one-fourth
of African blood.<a id='r29' /><a href='#f29' class='c014'><sup>[29]</sup></a> That State gave the right to vote also
to male inhabitants of Indian descent, but its court held
that a person having one-eighth Indian blood, one-fourth
or three-eighths African, and the rest white was not included
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>in that class.<a id='r30' /><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a> Ohio limited the suffrage to white
male citizens and made it the duty of judges of election
to challenge any one with a “distinct and visible admixture
of African blood,” but the latter requirement was
held unconstitutional in 1867,<a id='r31' /><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a> the court saying that,
where the white blood in a person predominated, he was
to be considered white. This definition is interesting because
it is the only instance found of a court’s saying
that a person with more than half white blood and the
rest Negro should be considered white. In contrast with
this is the following sweeping definition laid down in the
Tennessee statute: “All Negroes, Mulattoes, Mestizoes,<a id='r32' /><a href='#f32' class='c014'><sup>[32]</sup></a>
and their descendants, having any African blood in their
veins, shall be known in this State as ‘Persons of Color.’”<a id='r33' /><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a>
Arkansas also, in its statute separating the races
in trains, includes among persons of color all who have
“a visible and distinct admixture of African blood.”<a id='r34' /><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In everyday language, a mulatto is any person having
both Caucasian and Negro blood. But several States have
defined “mulatto” specifically. The Supreme Court of
Alabama<a id='r35' /><a href='#f35' class='c014'><sup>[35]</sup></a> held, in 1850, that a mulatto is the offspring of
a Negro and a white person, that the offspring of a white
person and a mulatto is not a mulatto; but this definition
was enlarged in 1867<a id='r36' /><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a> to include anyone descended from
Negro ancestors to the third generation inclusive, though
one ancestor in each generation be white. It has been
seen already that this was recently extended to the fifth
generation. The law of Missouri<a id='r37' /><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a> defines a mulatto
thus: “Every person other than a Negro, any one of
whose grandfathers or grandmothers is or shall have been
a Negro, although his or her other progenitors, except
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>those descending from the Negro, may have been white
persons, shall be deemed a mulatto, and every such person
who shall have one-fourth or more Negro blood shall
in like manner be deemed a mulatto.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Some States have allowed facts other than physical
characteristics to be presumptive of race. Thus, it has
been held in North Carolina<a id='r38' /><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a> that, if one was a slave in
1865, it is to be presumed that he was a Negro. The fact
that one usually associates with Negroes has been held
in the same State proper evidence to go to the jury tending
to show that he is a Negro.<a id='r39' /><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a> If a woman’s first
husband was a white man, that fact, in Texas,<a id='r40' /><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a> is admissible
evidence tending to show that she is a white
woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>One may ascertain how some of the States define the
other races from their laws against miscegenation. Thus,
Mississippi, in prohibiting intermarriage between Caucasians
and Mongolians, includes one having as much as
one-eighth Mongolian blood. Oregon makes its similar law
applicable to those having one-fourth or more Chinese or
Kanakan<a id='r41' /><a href='#f41' class='c014'><sup>[41]</sup></a> blood, or more than one-half Indian blood.
Thus, three-eighths of Indian blood would not be sufficient
to bar a man from intermarriage with a Caucasian,
but one-fourth Negro, Chinese, or Kanakan blood would.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above are the laws which define the races. The
interpretation of them is a different question. Some
statutes say that one is a person of color—in effect, a Negro—if
he is descended from a Negro to the third generation
inclusive, though one ancestor in each generation
may have been white; others define as a person of color
a man who has as much as one-eighth Negro blood; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>still others, one who has as much as one-fourth Negro
blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following diagram will probably clarify these
definitions:</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_034.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c007'>Suppose it is desired to ascertain whether the son X
is a white person or a Negro. The first generation above
him is that of his parents, M and N. If either of them is
white and the other a Negro, X has one-half Negro blood
and would be considered a Negro everywhere. The second
generation is that of his grandparents, I, J, K, and L.
If any one of them is a Negro and the other three white,
X has one-fourth Negro blood, and would be considered a
Negro in every State except possibly Ohio. The third
generation is that of his great-grandparents, A, B, C, D,
E, F, G, and H. If any one of these eight great-grandparents
is a Negro, X has one-eighth Negro blood and
would be considered a Negro in every State which defines
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>a person of color as one who has one-eighth Negro blood
or is descended from a Negro to the third generation inclusive.
Suppose, for instance, the great-grandfather A
was a Negro and all the rest of the great-grandparents
were white. The grandfather I would be half Negro; the
father M would be one-fourth Negro; and X would be
one-eighth Negro. Thus, though of the fourteen progenitors
of X only three had Negro blood, X would nevertheless
be considered a Negro.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the above illustrations only one of the progenitors
has been a Negro and his blood has been the only Negro
blood introduced into the line. Suppose, however, that
there is Negro blood in both branches of the family, as
where a mulatto marries a mulatto or a mulatto marries
a Negro. One with a mathematical turn of mind may
take these three generations and work out the various
other combinations which would give X one-half, one-fourth,
one-eighth, or any other fraction of Negro blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is safe to say that in practice one is a Negro or is
classed with that race if he has the least visible trace of
Negro blood in his veins, or even if it is known that there
was Negro blood in any one of his progenitors. Miscegenation
has never been a bridge upon which one might
cross from the Negro race to the Caucasian, though it has
been a thoroughfare from the Caucasian to the Negro.
Judges and legislators have gone the length of saying that
one drop of Negro blood makes a man a Negro, but to be
a Caucasian one must be all Caucasian. This shows very
clearly that they have not considered Negro blood on a
par with Caucasian; else, race affiliation would be determined
by predominance of blood. By the latter test, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>one had more Negro blood than white, he would be considered
a Negro; if more white than Negro, a Caucasian.
Therefore, at the very threshold of this subject, even in
the definitions of terms, one discovers a race distinction.
Whether it is a discrimination depends upon what one
considers the relative desirability of Caucasian and Negro
ancestry.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>PROPER NAME FOR BLACK MEN IN AMERICA</h3>

<p class='c012'>Having considered how the law defines that heterogeneous
group of people called Negroes, one is brought
face to face with the question: What, in actual practice,
is the proper name for the black man in America? Is it
“Negro?” Is it “colored person?” Is it “Afro-American?”
If not one of these, what is it? Among the members
of that group, the matter of nomenclature is of more
than academic interest. Thus, Rev. J. W. E. Bowen,
Professor of Historical Theology at Gamman Seminary,
Atlanta, and editor of <cite>The Voice of the Negro</cite>, in 1906,
published an article in that paper with the pertinent title,
“Who are We?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The ways of speaking of members of the Negro race
are various. In the laws, as has been shown, they are
called “Negroes,” “Persons of Color,” “Colored Persons,”
“Africans,” and “Persons of African Descent”—more
often “Persons of Color.” By those who would
speak dispassionately and scientifically they are called Negroes
and Afro-Americans. Those who are anxious not
to wound the feelings of that race speak of them as “Colored
People” or “Darkies”; while those who would speak
contemptuously of them say “Nigger” or “Coon.” “Nigger”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>is confined largely to the South; “Coon,” to the
rest of the country. Again, one occasionally finds
“Blacks” and “Black Men” in contradistinction to
“Whites” and “White Men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The question of the proper name for persons of African
descent was brought into prominence in 1906. In
that year a bill was laid before Congress relative to the
schools of the City of Washington, which provided that
the Board of Education should consist of nine persons,
three of whom should be “of the colored race.” Representative
Thetus W. Sims, of Tennessee, objected to the
phrase on the ground that it would include “Indians,
Chinese, Japanese, Malays, Sandwich Islanders, or any
persons of the colored race,” and insisted that “Negroes”
or “persons of the Negro race” should be substituted in
its place. He wrote to Dr. Booker T. Washington, as one
of the leaders of the Negro race, asking his views as to
the proper word. The following is part of his reply:
“... It has been my custom to write and speak of the
members of my race as Negroes, and when using the term
‘Negro’ as a race designation to employ the capital ‘N.’
To the majority of the people among whom we live I
believe this is customary and what is termed in the rhetorics
‘good usage.’... Rightly or wrongly, all classes
have called us Negroes. We cannot escape that if we
would. To cast it off would be to separate us, to a certain
extent, from our history, and deprive us of much of the
inspiration we now have to struggle on and upward. It
is to our credit, not to our shame, that we have risen so
rapidly, more rapidly than most other peoples, from savage
ancestors through slavery to civilization. For my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>part, I believe the memory of these facts should be preserved
in our name and traditions as it is preserved in the
color of our faces. I do not think my people should be
ashamed of their history, nor of any name that people
choose in good faith to give them.”<a id='r42' /><a href='#f42' class='c014'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Representative Sims’s objection to the phrase “of the
colored race” precipitated a discussion throughout the
country. The New York <cite>Tribune</cite><a id='r43' /><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a> made a canvass of a
great many prominent Negroes and white persons to ascertain
what they thought the Negro should be called.
The result of its inquiry is this: An average of eleven
Negroes out of twenty desired to be spoken of as Negroes.
The other nine spurned the word as “insulting,” “contemptuous,”
“degrading,” “vulgar.” Two argued for
“Afro-American,” two for “Negro-American,” one for
“black man,” and one was indifferent so long as he was
not called “Nigger.” Of the white men interviewed, ten
out of thirteen, on an average, preferred the word “Negro.”
The Negroes made a specially strong plea for capitalizing
the word “Negro,” saying that it was not fair
to accord that distinction to their dwarfish cousins, the
Negritos in the Philippines, and to the many savage
tribes in Africa and deny it to the black man in America.
They were also strongly opposed to the word “Negress”
as applied to the women of their race. This, they asserted,
is objectionable because of its historical significance. For
in times of slavery, “Negress” was the term applied
to a woman slave at an auction, in contradistinction to
“buck,” which referred to a male slave.</p>

<p class='c007'>E. A. Johnson, Professor of Law in Shaw University,
North Carolina, said: “The term ‘Afro-American’ is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>suggestive of an attempt to disclaim as far as possible
our Negro descent, and casts a slur upon it. It fosters the
idea of the inferiority of the race, which is an incorrect
notion to instill into the Negro youth, whom we are trying
to imbue with self-esteem and self-respect.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rev. J. W. E. Bowen, to whom reference has already
been made, said: “Let the Negroes, instead of bemourning
their lot and fretting because they are Negroes and trying
to escape themselves, rise up and wipe away the stain
from this word by glorious and resplendent achievements.
Good names are not given; they are made.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rev. H. H. Proctor, pastor of the First Congregational
Church, Atlanta, said: “What is needed is not to
change the name of the people, but the people of the name.
Make the term so honorable that men will consider it an
honor to be called a Negro.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rev. Walter H. Brooks, pastor of the Nineteenth
Street Baptist Church, Washington, wrote: “The black
people of America have but to augment their efforts in
lives of self-elevation and culture, and men will cease to
reproach us by any name whatever.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, Charles W. Anderson, Collector of Internal
Revenue, New York, said: “I am, therefore, inclined to
favor the use of ‘Negro,’ partly because to drop it would
expose me to the charge of being ashamed of my race (and
I hate any man who is ashamed of the race from which
he sprung), and partly because I know that no name or
term can confer or withhold relative rank in this life. All
races and men must win equality of rating and status for
themselves.”</p>

<p class='c007'>One is safe in concluding that the word “Negro”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>(with the capital “N”) will eventually be applied to the
black man in America. White people are distinctly in
favor of it: what Negroes now object to it do so because
of its corrupt form, “Nigger.” As the Negro shows his
ability to develop into a respectable and useful citizen, contemptuous
epithets will be dropped by all save the thoughtless
and vicious, and “Negro” will be recognized as the
race name.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>DEFAMATION TO CALL A WHITE PERSON A NEGRO</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There are certain words which are so universally considered
injurious to a person in his social or business relations
if spoken of him that the courts have held that the
speaker of such words is liable to an action for slander,
and damages are recoverable even though the one of whom
the words were spoken does not prove that he suffered any
special damage from the words having been spoken of
him. The speaking of such words is said to be actionable
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>. In short, all the world knows that it is injurious
to a man to speak such words of him, and the court does
not require proof of facts which all the world knows.
Such words are (1) those imputing an infamous crime;
(2) those disparaging to a person in his trade, business,
office, or profession; and (3) those imputing a loathsome
disease. Thus, to say that a man is a murderer is to
impute to him an infamous crime, and if he brings a suit
for slander, it is not necessary for him to prove that he
has been damaged by the statement. The result is the
same if one says that a person will not pay his debts, because
that injures him in his profession or business; or
that a man has the leprosy, because that is imputing to
him a loathsome disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>From early times, it has been held to be slander, actionable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span><i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>, to say of a white man that he is a Negro or
akin to a Negro. The courts have placed this under the
second class—that is, words disparaging to a person in his
trade, business, or profession. The first case in point
arose in South Carolina<a id='r44' /><a href='#f44' class='c014'><sup>[44]</sup></a> in 1791, when the courts held
that, if the words were true, the party (the white person)
would be deprived of all civil rights, and moreover, would
be liable to be tried in all cases, under the “Negro Act,”
without the privilege of a trial by jury, and that “any
words, therefore, which tended to subject a citizen to such
disabilities, were actionable.” In 1818, it was held actionable
by a court of the same State to call a white man’s
wife a mulatto.<a id='r45' /><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a> But an Ohio<a id='r46' /><a href='#f46' class='c014'><sup>[46]</sup></a> court, the same year, held
that it was not slander, actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i>, to charge a white
man with being akin to a Negro inasmuch as it did not
charge any crime or exclude one from society. The only
explanation, apparently, of this conflict between the decisions
of South Carolina and Ohio is that in the latter State
it was not considered as much an insult to impute Negro
blood to a white man as in the former. In North Carolina,<a id='r47' /><a href='#f47' class='c014'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
in 1860, there was the surprising decision that it was not
actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i> to call a white man a free Negro, even
though the white man was a minister of the gospel.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Supreme Court of Louisiana,<a id='r48' /><a href='#f48' class='c014'><sup>[48]</sup></a> in 1888, said: “Under
the social habits, customs, and prejudices prevailing
in Louisiana, it cannot be disputed that charging a white
man with being a Negro is calculated to inflict injury
and damage.... No one could make such a charge,
knowing it to be false, without understanding that its
effect would be injurious and without intending to injure.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1900, a Reverend Mr. Upton delivered a temperance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>address near New Orleans. The reporters, desiring to be
complimentary, referred to him as a “cultured gentleman.”
In the transmission of the dispatch by wire to
the New Orleans paper, the phrase was, by mistake,
changed to “colored gentleman.” The <cite>Times-Democrat</cite>
of that city, unwilling to refer to a member of the Negro
race as a “colored gentleman,” changed it to “Negro,”
and that was the word finally printed in the report. As
soon as he learned of the mistake, the editor of the paper
duly retracted and apologized. But Mr. Upton, not appeased,
brought a suit for libel and recovered fifty dollars
damages.<a id='r49' /><a href='#f49' class='c014'><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The <cite>News and Courier</cite>, of Charleston, South Carolina,
in 1905, in reporting a suit by A. M. Flood against
a street car company, referred to Mr. Flood as “colored.”
The latter brought suit against the newspaper and recovered
damages. In the course of its opinion, the court
said: “When we think of the radical distinction subsisting
between the white man and the black man, it must be
apparent that to impute the condition of the Negro to a
white man would affect his [the white man’s] social status,
and, in case anyone publish a white man to be a Negro,
it would not only be galling to his pride, but would tend
to interfere seriously with the social relation of the white
man with his fellow white men; and, to protect the white
man from such a publication, it is necessary to bring such
charge to an issue quickly.”<a id='r50' /><a href='#f50' class='c014'><sup>[50]</sup></a> The court adds that its decision
does not violate the Amendments to the Federal
Constitution, for these do not refer to the social condition
of the two races, but serve rather to give the two races
equal civil and political rights. Finally, the court says,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>quoting People v. Gallagher: “... if one race be inferior
to the other socially, the Constitution of the United States
cannot put them on the same plane.”<a id='r51' /><a href='#f51' class='c014'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Where laws separating the races in railroad trains and
street cars are in force, and the duty devolves upon the
conductors to assign passengers of the two races to their
respective coaches or compartments, it is surprising that
they do not more often make the mistakes of assigning
bright mulattoes to the white coach and dark-skinned
white persons to the colored. There are several instances
where the latter mistake has been made. One would not
expect a mulatto to resent being assigned to the white
coach and nothing would come of it, unless some white
passenger recognized him as being a Negro and objected;
but one would expect a white person to resent being assigned
to the “Jim Crow” compartment.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Atlanta, in 1904, a certain Mr. Wolfe and his sister
boarded a street car and took seats in the part of the
car reserved for white passengers. The conductor asked
them to move back, and when they asked the reason, he
answered that the rear of the car was for colored passengers.
The lady asked if he thought they were colored,
to which he replied: “Haven’t I seen you in colored company?”
Mr. Wolfe demanded an apology, and later
brought suit against the company. The court held that
the street car company was liable, and that the good faith
of the conductor in honestly thinking that they were Negroes
would serve only in mitigation of damages. Two
judges were of opinion that the company would not be
liable if the conductor used “extreme care and caution”
to ascertain the race of the passengers. The court held
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>that it would take judicial notice of the social status of
the two races and of their respective superiority and inferiority,
saying: “The question has never heretofore been
directly raised in this State as to whether it is an insult
to seriously call a white man a Negro or to intimate that
a person apparently white is of African descent. We have
no hesitation, however, after the most mature consideration
of every phase of the question, in declaring our deliberate
judgment to be that the wilful assertion or intimation
embodied in the declaration now before us constitutes
an actionable wrong. We cannot shut our eyes
to the facts of which courts are bound to take judicial
notice. Certainly every court is presumed to know the
habits of the people among which it is held, and their
characteristics, as well as to know leading historical events
and the law of the land. To recognize inequality as to the
civil or political rights belonging to any citizen or class
of citizens, or to attempt to fix the social status of any
citizen either by legislation or judicial decision, is repugnant
to every principle underlying our republican form of
government. Nothing is further from our purpose. Under
our institutions ‘every man is the architect of his own
fortune.’ Every citizen, white and black, may gain, in
every field of endeavor, the recognition his associates may
award. That is his right, and his own concern. But the
courts can take notice of the architecture without intermeddling
with the building of the structure. It is a matter
of common knowledge that, viewed from a social standpoint,
the Negro race is in mind and morals inferior to
the Caucasian. The record of each from the dawn of
historic times denies equality. The fact was recognized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>by two of the leaders on opposite sides of the question of
slavery, Abraham Lincoln and A. H. Stephens.”<a id='r52' /><a href='#f52' class='c014'><sup>[52]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The following is a recent case arising in Kentucky, in
which it was held that it is not slander <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i> to call a
white person a Negro: A white woman entered a coach
set apart for white people. The passengers therein complained
that she was a Negro, and the brakeman, on hearing
their remarks, asked her to go into the next coach.
When, upon reaching the other coach, she found that it
was set apart for Negroes, she left the train, which had
not yet started from the station. She met the conductor,
who, upon hearing her explanation, permitted her to go
her journey in the white coach. Later, she brought suit
against the railroad company and recovered a judgment
for four thousand dollars. Upon appeal, the judgment
of the lower court was reversed, the higher court saying:
“What race a person belongs to cannot always be determined
infallibly from appearances, and mistake must inevitably
be made. When a mistake is made, the carrier
is not liable in damages simply because a white person
was taken for a Negro, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</span></i>. It is not a legal
injury for a white person to be taken for a Negro. It
was not contemplated by the statute that the carrier should
be an insurer as to the race of its passengers. The carrier
is bound to exercise ordinary care in the matter, but
if it exercises ordinary care, and is not insulting to the
passenger, it is not liable for damages.”<a id='r53' /><a href='#f53' class='c014'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Probably the most recent case on the subject is one
which arose about two years ago in Virginia. A certain
Mrs. Stone boarded a train at Myrtle, Virginia. In spite
of her protests, the conductor compelled her to go into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the “Jim Crow” coach, thinking that she was a Negro.
After she had entered the car, a Negro passenger recognized
her and said, “Lor’, Miss Rosa, this ain’t no place
for you; you b’long in the cars back yonder.” Mrs. Stone
rode on to Suffolk, the next station, and left the train.
She sued the railroad company for one thousand dollars
damages. It appeared that Mrs. Stone was much tanned:
this probably caused the conductor to mistake her for a
Negro.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will have been noticed that all the courts which
have held it actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i> to call a white person a Negro
have been in the Southern States. It is doubtful
whether the courts in other sections would take the same
view, and even Kentucky, a Southern State, has refused
so to do. The attitude of the court depends upon whether
it is the consensus of opinion among the people of the
community that it is injurious to a white man in his business
and social relations to be called a Negro.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above is clearly another race distinction. Although
there are many decisions to the effect that it is
actionable <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per se</span></i> to call a white person a Negro, not one
can be found deciding whether it would be so to call a
Negro a white person. One event looks, in a measure, in
this direction. The city of Asheville, North Carolina, in
1906, contracted with a printer to have a new city directory
issued. The time-honored custom of the place was
to distinguish white and Negro citizens by means of an
asterisk placed before the names of all Negroes. After
the directory had been distributed, it was found that asterisks
had been placed before the names of two highly
respected white citizens, thus indicating that they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>of Negro lineage. From what has been seen, there is no
doubt that this would found an action for libel. The
newspaper report says: “On the heels of this suit brought
by Mr. Lancaster [one of the white persons], it is said
that Henry Pearson is seriously considering bringing suit
against the same people because an <em>asterisk was not</em><a id='r54' /><a href='#f54' class='c014'><sup>[54]</sup></a>
placed before his name. Henry is a Negro. In fact
he is one of the best-known Negroes in Asheville. He
is at present proprietor of the Royal Victoria, a Negro
hotel, and complains that he has been the object of many
unpleasant jests since the publication of the directory,
and likewise inquiries as to just ‘when he turned white.’
Pearson fears that if the report goes abroad that he is
a white man it will damage his hotel, and that the Negroes
who make his place headquarters and who pay into Henry’s
hands many shekels will cease to patronize his hotel,
and that his losses will be grievous.”<a id='r55' /><a href='#f55' class='c014'><sup>[55]</sup></a> This case is
unique; whether it has been brought to court is as yet
unknown. It is probable that to sustain his action it
would be necessary for the Negro to prove special damage
to his business; whereas Mr. Lancaster would not have
to allege or prove any damage at all. But, save in such
a case as the above, it would be hard to imagine a circumstance
in which a court would hold that it is injurious
to a Negro in his trade, business, office, profession, or
in his social relations to be called a white man.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>THE “BLACK LAWS” OF 1865–68</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One set of race distinctions deserves to be treated by
itself. They have long since become obsolete and were,
during their existence, in a sense, anomalous; yet they are,
perhaps, the most illuminating from a historical point
of view of all the race distinctions in the law. They
were the result of the statutes that were enacted by the
legislatures of the Southern States between 1865 and 1868
for the definition and establishment of the status of the
Negro. The War closed in 1865; the Fourteenth Amendment
to the Federal Constitution was ratified July 28,
1868; and the Reconstruction régime in the South was not
under way till 1868 or later. Therefore, during the interval
between the close of the War and the ratification
of the Fourteenth Amendment or the beginning of active
Reconstruction, the Southern States were free to adopt
such measures as they saw fit to establish the relation between
the races.</p>

<p class='c007'>The legislatures faced a new problem, or rather an old
problem increased many fold in perplexity. They had to
establish the industrial, legal, and political status of 4,000,000
people who had recently been slaves and were now
freemen. It must be remembered that when the Southern
legislatures convened in 1865 their actions with regard to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>the Negro were not beset by the limitations subsequently
fixed by the Federal Government. The first Civil Rights
Bill, that of 1866, had not been passed. The Southern
States were at liberty to enact such statutes as they
thought proper and to draw upon their own experience and
that of the free States with regard to free Negroes.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>“BLACK LAWS” OF FREE STATES</h3>

<p class='c012'>These statutes of 1865–68 are here called the “Black
Laws.” This term was first applied to the laws of the
border and Northern States passed before and up to the
Civil War to fix the position of free persons of color. It
is well to make a cursory examination of these laws of the
free States, because they are prototypes of many of the
statutes enacted by the Southern States while unhampered
by Federal legislation. All the States, North as well as
South, had previously faced the problem of the free Negro
and made laws concerning him. Naturally, therefore, the
South, now that all its Negroes were declared free, turned
for precedents to the other States which had already had
experience with the free Negro.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following are some of the statutes that had been
enacted with regard to free Negroes by States lying outside
of what was later the Confederacy:</p>

<p class='c007'>Maryland,<a id='r56' /><a href='#f56' class='c014'><sup>[56]</sup></a> in 1846, denied Negroes, slave or free, the
right to testify in cases in which any white person was
concerned, though it permitted the testimony of slaves
against free Negroes. The Constitution<a id='r57' /><a href='#f57' class='c014'><sup>[57]</sup></a> of 1851 forbade
the legislature to pass any law abolishing the relation of
master and servant.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Delaware,<a id='r58' /><a href='#f58' class='c014'><sup>[58]</sup></a> in 1851, prohibited the immigration of free
Negroes from any State except Maryland: moreover, it
forbade them to attend camp meetings, except for religious
worship under the control of white people, or political
gatherings. A law of 1852 provided that no free Negroes
should have the right to vote or “to enjoy any other rights
of a freeman other than to hold property, or to obtain
redress in law and in equity for any injury to his or her
person or property.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Missouri,<a id='r59' /><a href='#f59' class='c014'><sup>[59]</sup></a> in 1847, forbade the immigration into the
State of any free Negro; enacted that no person should
keep a school for the instruction of Negroes in reading
and writing; forbade any religious meetings of Negroes
unless a justice of the peace, constable, or other officer
was present; and declared that schools and religious meetings
for free Negroes were “unlawful assemblages.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ohio, which probably had the most notorious “Black
Laws” of any free State, “required colored people to give
bonds for good behavior as a condition of residence, excluded
them from the schools, denied them the rights of
testifying in courts of justice when a white man was party
on either side, and subjected them to other unjust and degrading
disabilities.”<a id='r60' /><a href='#f60' class='c014'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Indiana,<a id='r61' /><a href='#f61' class='c014'><sup>[61]</sup></a> in 1851, prohibited free Negroes and mulattoes
from coming into the State, and fined all persons who
employed or encouraged them to remain in the State between
ten and five hundred dollars for each offense.<a id='r62' /><a href='#f62' class='c014'><sup>[62]</sup></a> The
fines were to be devoted to a fund for the colonization of
Negroes.<a id='r63' /><a href='#f63' class='c014'><sup>[63]</sup></a> A law, which was submitted to a special vote
and passed by a majority of ninety thousand, prohibited
intermarriage between the races, provided for colonization
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>of Negroes, and made incompetent the testimony of persons
having one-eighth or more Negro blood.<a id='r64' /><a href='#f64' class='c014'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Illinois,<a id='r65' /><a href='#f65' class='c014'><sup>[65]</sup></a> in 1853, made it a misdemeanor for a Negro
to come into the State with the intention of residing there,
and provided that persons violating this law should be
prosecuted and fined or sold for a time to pay the fine.<a id='r66' /><a href='#f66' class='c014'><sup>[66]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Iowa,<a id='r67' /><a href='#f67' class='c014'><sup>[67]</sup></a> in 1851, forbade the immigration of free Negroes,<a id='r68' /><a href='#f68' class='c014'><sup>[68]</sup></a>
and provided that free colored persons should not
give testimony in cases in which a white man was a party.</p>

<p class='c007'>Oregon,<a id='r69' /><a href='#f69' class='c014'><sup>[69]</sup></a> in 1849, forbade the entrance of Negroes as
settlers or inhabitants, the reason being that it would be
dangerous to have them associate with the Indians and
incite the latter to hostility against white people.</p>

<p class='c007'>This sketch of the “Black Laws” of some of the free
States, incomplete as it is, is sufficient to show how those
States regarded free Negroes. First, they tried to keep
Negroes out; and, secondly, they subjected those that remained
to various disabilities. When the first Civil Rights
Bill was before Congress, the strongest opposition to its
passage was on the ground that it would compel the free
States to repeal these “Black Laws” and allow Negroes
to intermarry with whites, attend the same schools, sit
on juries, vote, bear firearms,<a id='r70' /><a href='#f70' class='c014'><sup>[70]</sup></a> etc. The free Negro constituted
a distinct class between the slave and the master,
his condition being more nearly that of a slave.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Southern States had been afraid of the free Negro.
He was a sort of irresponsible being, neither bond
nor free, who was likely to spread and foster discontent
among the slaves. When a slave was emancipated, it was
desired that he leave the State forthwith. Thus, the Virginia
Constitution<a id='r71' /><a href='#f71' class='c014'><sup>[71]</sup></a> of 1850 provided that emancipated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>slaves who remained in the Commonwealth more than
twelve months after they became actually free, should forfeit
their freedom and be reduced to slavery under such
regulations as the law might prescribe. The free Negro
was truly between the devil and the deep sea. If he stayed
in the State, he would be reënslaved; if he went to a free
State, he would be liable to prosecution there for violating
the laws against the immigration of free persons of
color.</p>

<p class='c007'>As one turns to the first laws passed by the Southern
States after Emancipation, he should keep in mind that
these States were only grappling with the old problem of
the free Negro, now on a much larger scale, which problem
the free States had disposed of already in the manner
just seen. As yet, the Southern States had no conception
of the Negro as a citizen with inalienable rights to be
recognized and protected. For instance, the Constitution
of Mississippi<a id='r72' /><a href='#f72' class='c014'><sup>[72]</sup></a> of 1832, as amended August 1, 1865,
abolished slavery and empowered the legislature to make
laws for the protection and security of the persons and
property of freedmen, and to guard “them and the State
against any evils that may arise from their sudden emancipation.”
And the laws of South Carolina,<a id='r73' /><a href='#f73' class='c014'><sup>[73]</sup></a> of the same
year, provided that, “although such persons [Negroes]
are not entitled to social or political equality with white
persons,” they might hold property, make contracts, etc.
except as hereinafter modified.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>RESTRICTIONS UPON MOVEMENT OF NEGROES</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>After 1865 there was comparatively little legislation
as to the movement of Negroes from one State to another.
It would have been utterly impossible to control the migration
of the 4,000,000 Negroes then in the United States.
In States where the free Negroes were numbered by only
hundreds or even thousands, the entrance or exit of one
was a noticeable event. Where, however, Negroes were
in the majority, a hundred might have come or gone at
once without being noticed. The Constitution of Georgia<a id='r74' /><a href='#f74' class='c014'><sup>[74]</sup></a>
of 1865 empowered the general assembly to make
laws for the regulation or prohibition of the immigration
of free persons of color into that State from other places;
but the legislature seems not to have used this power.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two years earlier, in 1863, the legislature of Kentucky<a id='r75' /><a href='#f75' class='c014'><sup>[75]</sup></a>
had declared that it was unlawful for any Negro
or mulatto claiming to be free under the Emancipation
Proclamation of January 1, 1863, or under any other
proclamation by the Government of the United States,
to migrate to or remain in the State. Any Negro violating
this law was treated as a runaway slave.</p>

<p class='c007'>A law of South Carolina,<a id='r76' /><a href='#f76' class='c014'><sup>[76]</sup></a> of 1865, provided that no
person of color should migrate to or reside in the State
unless, within twenty days after his arrival, he entered into
a bond with two freeholders as sureties in a penalty of
one thousand dollars, conditioned on his good behavior
and for his support if he should become unable to support
himself. If he should fail to execute the required bond,
he had to leave the State within ten days, or be liable to
corporal punishment. If, after being so punished, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>should still remain in the State fifteen days longer, he was
to be transported beyond the limits of the State for life
“or kept at hard labor, with occasional solitary confinement,
for a period not exceeding five years.” The same
punishment of banishment for life, or confinement and
hard labor for a term was prescribed for any person of
color coming or being brought into South Carolina after
having been convicted of an infamous crime in another
State.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the Southern States believed that the day of the
Negro as a laborer was over was evidenced, not only by
their efforts to keep Negroes out of the State, but also by
the fact that so many of them, during the first years after
the War, passed statutes encouraging and offering inducements
to foreign immigrants. The movement to bring
foreigners into the South is still going on, but it has never
met with much success.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although to-day many places, both in the North and
in the South, do not permit Negroes to reside within their
borders or even to stay over night, the above are apparently
the last instances where attempts to limit the movement
of Negroes<a id='r77' /><a href='#f77' class='c014'><sup>[77]</sup></a> have been made by State legislatures. Most
of the States have concluded to allow Negroes to come
and go at will, but to fix their status while in the State.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>LIMITATIONS UPON NEGROES IN RESPECT TO OCCUPATIONS</h3>

<p class='c012'>From some occupations Negroes were wholly excluded;
others, they were permitted to engage in, only after obtaining
licenses. The Alabama Code<a id='r78' /><a href='#f78' class='c014'><sup>[78]</sup></a> of 1867 provided that
no free Negro should be licensed to keep a tavern or to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>sell vinous or spirituous liquors. There had been a statute
of the same State which declared that a free Negro should
not be employed to sell or to assist in the sale of drugs
or medicine, under a penalty of one hundred dollars, but
this had been repealed in 1866.<a id='r79' /><a href='#f79' class='c014'><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In South Carolina,<a id='r80' /><a href='#f80' class='c014'><sup>[80]</sup></a> it was unlawful for a Negro
either to own a distillery of spirituous liquors or any establishment
where they were sold. The violation of this
law was a misdemeanor punishable by fine, corporal punishment
or hard labor. The law of this State<a id='r81' /><a href='#f81' class='c014'><sup>[81]</sup></a> went still
further by enacting that no person of color should pursue
or practice the art, trade, or business of an artisan, mechanic,
or shopkeeper, “or any other trade, employment,
or business (besides that of husbandry, or that of a servant
under contract for service or labor) on his own account
and for his own benefit, or in partnership with a
white person, or as agent or servant of any person” until he
should have obtained a license. This license was good for
one year only. Before granting the license the judge had
to be satisfied of the skill, fitness, and good moral character
of the applicant. If the latter wished to be a shopkeeper
or peddler, the annual license fee was one hundred
dollars; if a mechanic, artisan, or a member of any other
trade, ten dollars. The judge might revoke the license
upon a complaint made to him. Negroes could not practice
any mechanical art or trade without showing either
that they had served their term of apprenticeship or were
then practicing the art or trade. For violation of this rule,
the Negro had to pay a fine of double the amount of the
license, one-half to go to the informer.</p>

<p class='c007'>In some States, there was a limitation upon the right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>of Negroes to hold land as tenants. A statute of Mississippi<a id='r82' /><a href='#f82' class='c014'><sup>[82]</sup></a>
in 1865 gave them the right to sue and be sued, to
hold property, etc., but declared that the provisions of the
statute should not be construed to allow any freeman, free
Negro, or mulatto to rent or lease any lands, except in incorporated
towns or cities in which places the corporate
authorities should control the same. The same statute
required every freeman, free Negro, or mulatto to have on
January 1, 1866, and annually thereafter, a lawful home
and employment with written evidence thereof. If living
in an incorporated town, he must have a license from the
mayor, authorizing him to do irregular job work—that is,
if he was not under some written contract for service; if
living outside such a town, he must have a similar license
from a member of the board of police of his precinct.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tennessee,<a id='r83' /><a href='#f83' class='c014'><sup>[83]</sup></a> on the other hand, went to the length of expressly
throwing open all trades to Negroes who complied
with the license laws which were applicable to whites and
blacks alike.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SALE OF FIREARMS AND LIQUOR TO NEGROES</h3>

<p class='c012'>A fruitful subject of legislation was that relative to the
sale of firearms to Negroes. On January 15, 1866, the
legislature of Florida<a id='r84' /><a href='#f84' class='c014'><sup>[84]</sup></a> enacted a law declaring that
it was unlawful for a Negro to own, use, or keep in his
possession or control “any bowie-knife, dirk, sword, firearms
or ammunition of any kind” unless he had obtained
a license from the probate judge of the county. To
get the license, he had to present the certificate of two
respectable citizens of the county as to the peaceful and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>orderly character of the applicant. The violation of this
statute was a misdemeanor punishable by the forfeiture to
the use of the informer of such firearms and ammunition
and by standing in a pillory one hour or by being whipped
not over thirty-nine stripes.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Mississippi<a id='r85' /><a href='#f85' class='c014'><sup>[85]</sup></a> the law was that any freedman, free
Negro, or mulatto, not in the military service of the United
States nor having a specified license, who should keep or
carry firearms of any kind or any ammunition, dirk, or
bowie-knife should be punished by a fine of not over ten
dollars, and all such arms, etc., should be forfeited to the
informer. The law further provided that, if any white
person lent or gave a freedman, free Negro, or mulatto any
firearms, ammunition, dirk, or bowie-knife, such white
person should be fined not over fifty dollars, or imprisoned
not over thirty days. South Carolina<a id='r86' /><a href='#f86' class='c014'><sup>[86]</sup></a> did allow a Negro
who was the owner of a farm, to keep a “shot-gun or rifle,
such as is ordinarily used in hunting, but not a pistol, musket,
or other firearm or weapon appropriate for purposes
of war.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been seen that some States forbade Negroes to
make or sell intoxicating liquor. Others went a step further
and made it unlawful to sell liquor to Negroes. It
is worth noting that one of the early acts of the legislature
of Alabama<a id='r87' /><a href='#f87' class='c014'><sup>[87]</sup></a> was to repeal such a law. But Kentucky<a id='r88' /><a href='#f88' class='c014'><sup>[88]</sup></a>
forbade a coffee-house keeper to sell liquor to free Negroes
under penalty of a bond of five hundred dollars. Mississippi<a id='r89' /><a href='#f89' class='c014'><sup>[89]</sup></a>
made it an offence, punishable by a fine of not over
fifty dollars or imprisonment for not more than thirty days,
for a white man to sell, give, or lend a Negro any intoxicating
liquors, except that a master, mistress, or employer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>might give him spirituous liquors, but not in quantities
sufficient to produce intoxication.</p>

<p class='c007'>These laws against the sale of firearms and liquor to
Negroes probably grew out of a fear by the white people
of a Negro uprising, such as had occurred during slavery.
The South was in such a turmoil immediately after the
War that stringent precautionary measures were considered
necessary. These statutes have analogies in the present
laws of the Western States against the sale of firearms
and liquor to Indians. The law of Arizona<a id='r90' /><a href='#f90' class='c014'><sup>[90]</sup></a> declares that
anyone who sells or gives intoxicating liquor to an Indian
is guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished by a fine
of between one hundred and three hundred dollars or imprisoned
between one and six months, or both. The sale
or gift or repair of firearms was added in 1883.<a id='r91' /><a href='#f91' class='c014'><sup>[91]</sup></a> Idaho<a id='r92' /><a href='#f92' class='c014'><sup>[92]</sup></a>
has a law very much the same, making the fine, however,
not over five hundred dollars or the term of imprisonment
not over six months, or both. Dakota Territory,<a id='r93' /><a href='#f93' class='c014'><sup>[93]</sup></a> in 1865,
made it a misdemeanor to sell or give liquor to Indians.
Nebraska,<a id='r94' /><a href='#f94' class='c014'><sup>[94]</sup></a> in 1881, made it an offence punishable by a fine
of fifty dollars to sell liquor to them, and in 1891 made it
a felony to sell or give liquor to any Indian not a citizen,
attaching a fine of not over one thousand dollars or imprisonment
in the penitentiary between two and five years.
New Mexico<a id='r95' /><a href='#f95' class='c014'><sup>[95]</sup></a> makes the punishment a fine between twenty
and one hundred dollars or imprisonment not over three
months. Utah<a id='r96' /><a href='#f96' class='c014'><sup>[96]</sup></a> makes the punishment a fine between ten
and one hundred dollars. The law of Oregon<a id='r97' /><a href='#f97' class='c014'><sup>[97]</sup></a> made it
lawful for every <em>white</em> male citizen of the age of sixteen
to keep and carry certain arms, impliedly denying that
right to other races. Washington<a id='r98' /><a href='#f98' class='c014'><sup>[98]</sup></a> made the punishment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>for selling or giving liquor to Indians a fine of between
twenty-five and one hundred dollars. As late as 1903 one
finds in the revised statutes of Maine<a id='r99' /><a href='#f99' class='c014'><sup>[99]</sup></a> a provision that
one who sells or gives to an Indian intoxicating liquors
forfeits not less than five nor more than twenty dollars,
one-half to complainant. It must be clear that the foregoing
laws were not passed solely for the moral uplift of
the Indian, but quite as much as a protection to white
people from drunken Indians. A similar motive must have
actuated the Southern States in enacting the laws of 1865–1868,
and it has been, at least, one incentive for the
present prohibition legislation in the South.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>LABOR CONTRACTS OF NEGROES</h3>

<p class='c012'>Another common form of legislation with regard to free
Negroes was that relative to their contracts for personal
service. A Florida<a id='r100' /><a href='#f100' class='c014'><sup>[100]</sup></a> statute of 1865 required that all contracts
with persons of color should be in writing and fully
explained to them before two credible witnesses, and that
one copy of the contract should be kept by the employer
and the other by some judicial officer of the State and
county wherein the service was to be performed. Contracts
for less than thirty days might be oral. The Negro who
failed to perform his contract by wilful disobedience of orders,
wanton impudence, or disrespect, failure or refusal to
do the work assigned to him, idleness, or abandonment of
the premises, was treated as a vagrant. In 1866<a id='r101' /><a href='#f101' class='c014'><sup>[101]</sup></a> the law
ceased to be a race distinction when, by a new enactment,
it was greatly limited and made applicable to whites and
blacks alike.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>The law of Kentucky<a id='r102' /><a href='#f102' class='c014'><sup>[102]</sup></a> required contracts between
white persons and Negroes to be in writing and attested by
some white person. The contracts were to be treated as
entire, so that, if either party should, without good cause,
abandon the contract, the other should be held to have performed
his obligation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mississippi<a id='r103' /><a href='#f103' class='c014'><sup>[103]</sup></a> enacted that all contracts for labor with
freedmen, free Negroes, or mulattoes for a longer period
than one month should be in writing, attested by two disinterested
white persons in the county where the labor was
to be performed, and read to the Negro by some officer. If
the laborer quit without good cause before the expiration
of the term, he forfeited his wages for the year up to the
time of quitting. That State made it the duty of every
civil officer and the option of every other person to arrest
and carry back to his employer every Negro laborer who
had left, and the person making the arrest was entitled to
receive five dollars as a fee and ten cents per mile from the
place of arrest to the place of delivery, the same to be paid
by the employer and taken out of the wages of the Negro.
The Negro might appeal to a justice of the peace who
might summarily try the merits of the case. Then, either
the master or the servant might appeal to the county
court which had power to remand the deserter to the employer
or to dispose of him otherwise as it thought right
and just, and its decision was final.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Virginia<a id='r104' /><a href='#f104' class='c014'><sup>[104]</sup></a> all contracts for service between a white
person and a Negro for more than two months had to be
in writing, signed by both parties, acknowledged before a
justice of the peace, notary public, clerk of the county or
corporation court, overseer of the poor, or two or more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>credible witnesses in the county or corporation where the
work was to be done. And the justice, notary, etc., had to
read and explain the contract to the Negro.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of all the Southern States, South Carolina<a id='r105' /><a href='#f105' class='c014'><sup>[105]</sup></a> went
much the furthest into detail as to contracts for service.
Persons of color who made contracts for service or labor
were to be known as servants, and those with whom they
contracted, as masters. Contracts for one month or more
must be in writing, attested by one white witness, and
approved by the judge of the district court or a magistrate.
If the period of service was not mentioned, it was until
the twenty-fifth of December next after making the contract.
If the wages were not stipulated, they were to be
fixed by the district judge or magistrate on application by
one of the parties and notice to the other. A Negro, ten
years or more of age, having no parent living in the district
and not an apprentice, might make a valid contract
for a year or less. Contracts must be presented for approval
within twenty days. Contracts for one month or
more were not binding on the servant unless written and
approved. Failure to make such a written contract was a
misdemeanor punishable by a fine of from five dollars to
fifty dollars. If the servant received only board and clothing,
a written contract was unnecessary. The fee for approval
ranged between twenty-five cents for a contract of
one month or less to one dollar for a contract for one year
and one dollar for each year or part of a year in addition,
half the fee to be paid by each party.</p>

<p class='c007'>Labor on farms was minutely regulated. Hours of
labor, except on Sundays, were from sunrise to sunset,
with a reasonable interval for breakfast and dinner.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>Servants must “rise at the dawn in the morning, feed,
water, and care for the animals on the farm, do the usual
and needful work about the premises, prepare their meals
for the day, if required by the master, and begin the farm
work or other work by sunrise.” They must be careful of
all the animals and property of their masters, and especially
of the animals and implements used by them; must prevent
them from injury by others. They were answerable for
all property lost, destroyed, or injured by their negligence,
dishonesty, or bad faith.</p>

<p class='c007'>All lost time, not occasioned by the master, and all
losses caused by neglect of duty might be deducted from
the wages of the servant. Food, nursing, and other necessaries
for the servant, while absent from work on account
of sickness or other cause, might also be deducted. Servants
must be quiet and orderly in their quarters, at their
work, and on the premises. They must extinguish their
lights and fires, and retire to rest at seasonable hours.
Work at night and out-door work in bad weather was not
to be exacted except in cases of necessity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Servants were not to be kept at home on Sundays unless
to take care of the premises or animals, for work of
daily necessity, or on unusual occasions; and then only so
many as were necessary to do the work. Sunday work
must be done by them in turn, except in cases of sickness
or disability, when the work might be assigned
out of order. Those away on Sunday must be back by
sunset.</p>

<p class='c007'>Masters might give servants tasks, and might require
them to rate themselves as full hands, three-quarters, half,
or one-quarter in order to determine the task. If the servant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>complained of the task, the district judge or magistrate
might reduce or increase it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Visitors of servants could not be invited or allowed by
the servants to come on the premises of the master without
his express consent, nor could servants be absent from the
premises without such permission.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the servant left his employment without good cause,
he forfeited all the wages due him. He must obey all lawful
orders of the master or his agent, and “be honest,
truthful, sober, civil, and diligent in his business.” The
master might moderately correct servants under eighteen
years of age. He was not liable to pay for any additional
services of a servant, if they were necessary, except by express
agreement.</p>

<p class='c007'>The master might discharge the servant for: (1) wilful
disobedience of the lawful order of himself or his agent;
(2) habitual negligence or indolence in business; (3)
drunkenness, grossly immoral or illegal conduct; (4) want
of respect and courtesy to himself, his family, guests, or
agents; (5) or for prolonged absence from the premises, or
absence on two or more occasions without permission. Or,
if the master preferred, he might report the servant to the
district judge or magistrate, who had power to inflict suitable
corporal punishment or impose a fine, and remand
him to work; the fine to be deducted from the wages, if
not paid. These were the means by which the judge or
magistrate might compel the servant to perform his contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>The master was not liable to third persons for the voluntary
trespasses, torts, and misdemeanors of his servants.
Nor was he liable for any contract of his servant unless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>made with the master’s authority, nor for any acts of the
servant unless done within the scope of his authority or in
the course of his employment. It was the master’s duty
to protect his servant from violence at the hands of others
and to aid him in getting redress for injuries.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a person to deprive the master of the services of
his servant, knowing him to be such, by enticing him away,
harboring him, detaining him, beating, confining, disabling,
or in any way injuring him was punishable by a fine of
from twenty dollars to two hundred dollars, and imprisonment
or hard labor for not over sixty days. In addition,
the master might recover damages for loss of such services.</p>

<p class='c007'>The master had the right to command the servant to
aid him in the defence of his own person, family, premises,
or property. He did not have to furnish medicine or medical
assistance to the servant unless he especially agreed to
do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>The master might inform a prospective employer of
the character of a Negro who had been in his service, and
this was a privileged communication unless falsely and
maliciously made. The servant could not make a new
contract without producing the discharge of his former
master or of the district judge or magistrate.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the master was convicted of a felony or if he managed
or controlled his servants so as to make them a nuisance
to the neighborhood, any white freeholder might complain
to the district judge and have the contract annulled,
and the master could not employ any colored servant
within two years.</p>

<p class='c007'>A servant had the right to leave his master’s service for:
(1) an insufficient supply of food; (2) an unauthorized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>battery upon his person or upon a member of his family,
not committed in the defence of the person, family, guest,
or agent of the master; (3) invasion by the master of the
conjugal rights of the servant; (4) or failure by the master
to pay wages when due. In any one of the above cases,
the servant might collect his wages due him at the time of
his departure.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the master died, the contract—contrary to the usual
rule of law—was not terminated without the assent of the
servant. His wages up to one year took preference over
other debts of the master. If the servant was wrongfully
discharged, he could collect wages for the whole period
of the contract. Upon the servant’s discharge or the expiration
of his term of service, the master must furnish him
a certificate of discharge, and upon his request, a certificate
of character. If the servant forged or altered this certificate—as
by falsely claiming that he had been in a certain
previous service—he was guilty of a misdemeanor,
punishable by a fine of not over one hundred dollars. All
disputes as to alleged wrongful discharges or departures
were to be heard by the district judge, who could compel
the master to take back the servant or forfeit a penalty of
a fine of twenty dollars; or compel the servant to return
to his master under pain of corporal punishment or fine.</p>

<p class='c007'>A servant was not liable for contracts made by the express
authority of his master. Nor was he liable civilly or
criminally for any act done by the command of his master
in defence of his master’s person, family, guest, servant,
premises, or property.</p>

<p class='c007'>Negroes employed as house servants had, at “all hours
of the day and night, and on all days of the week,” to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>answer promptly all calls and execute all lawful orders and
commands of the master’s family. They had to be especially
civil and polite to their master, his family, and
guests, for which they in turn should “receive gentle and
kind treatment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The statute provided for a regular form of contract between
master and servant, which was understood to include
all of the above stipulations unless otherwise provided.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>APPRENTICE LAWS</h3>

<p class='c012'>The early legislatures also made detailed apprentice
laws. Although it is scarcely open to argument that, in
making such laws, they did not have in mind primarily
Negroes, still many of the statutes made no mention of
race, and, therefore, cannot be properly discussed here.
Thus, Alabama<a id='r106' /><a href='#f106' class='c014'><sup>[106]</sup></a> had a long statute on apprentices, but the
only reference to the Negro was the rule that, if the minor
be a child of a freedman, the former owner of the child
should have the preference of apprenticing him, if a suitable
person.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Kentucky,<a id='r107' /><a href='#f107' class='c014'><sup>[107]</sup></a> if the apprentice was white, the master
must teach him reading, writing, and common arithmetic
up to and including the “Rule of Three”; if a
Negro, the master must pay at the end of the apprenticeship
fifty dollars to a girl and one hundred dollars to a
boy, but if the master should teach the apprentice to read
and write, he was not bound to pay any money. In Kentucky,
also, in apprenticing Negroes, preference was given
to their former owners, if the latter were suitable persons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mississippi<a id='r108' /><a href='#f108' class='c014'><sup>[108]</sup></a> had an elaborate apprentice law which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>related only to freedmen, free Negroes, and mulattoes. The
sheriffs, justices of the peace, and other civil officers of the
county had to report to the probate court semiannually, in
January and July, the names of all freedmen, free Negroes,
and mulattoes, under the age of eighteen, who where orphans
or whose parents were unable or unwilling to support
them. It was the duty of the court, thereupon, to
order the apprenticing of such minors, preference being
given to their former masters if suitable persons. The
master had to furnish a bond payable to the State conditioned
upon his furnishing the minor with sufficient food
and clothing, treating him humanely, giving him medical
attention when sick, and, if the minor was under fifteen,
teaching him or having him taught to read and write.
Males were bound till they were twenty-one; females, till
they were eighteen. The master could inflict moderate corporal
chastisement as a father or guardian might do; but
in no case could he inflict cruel or inhuman punishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the apprentice ran away, the master might pursue
him and bring him before a justice of the peace who could
remand him to the service of his master. If the apprentice
refused to return, he might be put into jail until the next
term of the court, when his case would be investigated. If
it was found that he left without cause, he could be punished
like a hired freedman; but if he had a good cause, the
court might discharge him and enter judgment against his
master for not over one hundred dollars to be paid to the
apprentice. Anyone enticing an apprentice away from his
master, knowingly employing him, furnishing him food or
clothing, or giving or selling him liquor without the master’s
consent was guilty of a high misdemeanor.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>If the master wished to get rid of the apprentice, he
might go before the probate court, which could cancel his
bond, and re-apprentice the minor. If the master died, the
court in re-apprenticing would give preference to the widow
or other member of the family of the deceased. If the
master wished to move to another State and take his apprentice
with him, he had to execute a bond conditioned
upon his compliance with the apprentice laws of the State
to which he was going. Any parent of a free Negro or
mulatto might apprentice his minor child, and if the age
could not be fixed by record testimony, the court fixed it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only race distinction made by North Carolina<a id='r109' /><a href='#f109' class='c014'><sup>[109]</sup></a>
was the law that no white child should be bound to a colored
master or mistress, and this came in 1874—long after
the period here considered.</p>

<p class='c007'>The apprentice laws of South Carolina<a id='r110' /><a href='#f110' class='c014'><sup>[110]</sup></a> which applied
only to Negroes were almost as elaborate as those of Mississippi.
A child over two years of age, born of a colored
parent, might be bound as an apprentice to any respectable
white or colored person; if a male, till he was twenty-one;
if a female, till she was eighteen. Illegitimate children
might be bound out by their mother. If the child had
no parent in the district; or if his parents were paupers,
or unable to support him, or were not teaching him the
habits of industry and honesty, or were of a notoriously
bad character or vagrants, or if either of them had been
convicted of an infamous crime, he might be apprenticed
by the district judge or by a magistrate. Males of twelve
and females of ten had to sign the contract of apprenticeship
and were bound thereby; but their refusal to sign
would not affect the validity of the instrument. If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>apprenticeship was voluntary, the contract had to be under
seal, signed by the master, parent, and apprentice, attested
by two credible witnesses, and approved by the district
judge or magistrate. One copy of the contract was kept
by the master, another, filed in the office of the clerk of
court. The master had to pay three dollars for the approval
of the contract by the district judge or magistrate.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other duties devolving upon the master were to teach
the apprentice the business of husbandry or some other useful
trade or business specified in the contract; to furnish
him wholesome food and suitable clothing; to teach him
habits of industry, honesty, and morality; to govern and
treat him with humanity; and if there was a colored school
within convenient distance, to send him to school as much
as six weeks of each year after he was ten years of age. The
teacher of such school must have the license of the district
judge to establish it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The master could inflict moderate chastisement, impose
reasonable restraint on the apprentice, and bring him
back if he ran away. If the master neglected his duty or
subjected the apprentice to the danger of moral contamination,
the district judge might dissolve the relation of master
and apprentice. All cases of dispute between master
and apprentice were to be tried before a magistrate, who
had the power to punish the party found to be at fault.
If the judge ordered the apprentice discharged for immoderate
correction or unlawful restraint, the master might be
indicted and punished by a fine of not over fifty dollars
or imprisonment of thirty days. In addition, the apprentice
had an action for damages.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the expiration of the term of service, the apprentice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>was entitled to not over sixty dollars from his master.
To the apprentice also applied the provisions for the servant
under contract, which have been considered, except that
the master was bound to furnish him medical aid, as he
did not have to do in the case of the servant. And for
apprentices also, as in the case of servants, there was a regular
form of contract which was understood to contain all
the above stipulations.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Delaware,<a id='r111' /><a href='#f111' class='c014'><sup>[111]</sup></a> not a Southern State, but much like the
Southern States in its dealings with the Negro, in its code
of 1852 as amended in 1893, is this belated statute: “Any
two justices of the peace, on receiving information of any
Negro or mulatto child in their county, having no parents
in this State, or who, being under the age of fifteen years,
have no parent able to maintain them, or who do not bring
them up to industry and stable employment, shall issue
process to a constable commanding him to bring such child
before them at a specified time and place, and to give notice
thereof to the parents, if any, and shall thereupon inquire
into their circumstances; and if it appear to be a proper
case for binding such child, they shall proceed to bind said
child as a servant, unless they shall deem the binding,
under the circumstances, to be inexpedient.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The constitutionality of these apprentice laws was
tested as early as 1867.<a id='r112' /><a href='#f112' class='c014'><sup>[112]</sup></a> A Negro girl, who had been a
slave in Maryland and had been freed by the Constitution
of that State, November 1, 1864, was, two days later, apprenticed
by her mother to her former master. The laws
governing Negro apprentices differed from those governing
white apprentices in that the master did not obligate himself
to teach the Negro apprentice reading, writing, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>arithmetic, and retained the right to transmit the apprentice
anywhere in the county. Upon a petition for a writ
of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas corpus</span></i>, the Federal court held that the Maryland
law resulted in practical slavery and, hence, violated the
Thirteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Bill of 1866.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other Southern States had apprentice laws, possibly
as detailed as the ones here considered, but they cannot
be treated of here because they applied to white and
colored children alike.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>VAGRANCY LAWS</h3>

<p class='c012'>The present vagrancy laws of the South have been
much criticised for the reason, as it is alleged, that they
are used to get recruits for chain gangs and convict camps,
and that Negro vagrants are taken up while white vagrants
go scotfree. Be that as it may, the fault lies with the officers,
not with the law, for the law, on its face, applies to
both races equally. But the first years after the War did
witness the enactment of vagrancy laws which had special
application to Negroes. Some States passed vagrancy laws
which made no race distinction, but, as in the case of apprentices,
it is beyond dispute that they were aimed especially
at the Negro.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following persons South Carolina<a id='r113' /><a href='#f113' class='c014'><sup>[113]</sup></a> classed as vagrants:
(1) all persons who have not some fixed and known
place of abode, and some lawful and reputable employment;
(2) those who have not some visible and known means of
a fair, honest, and reputable livelihood; (3) all common
prostitutes; (4) those who are found wandering from place
to place, vending, bartering, or peddling any articles or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>commodities without a license; (5) all common gamblers;
(6) persons who lead idle or disorderly lives, or keep or
frequent disorderly or disreputable houses or places; (7)
those who, not having sufficient means of support, are able
to work and do not work; (8) those who (whether or not
they own lands, or are lessees or mechanics) do not provide
a reasonable and proper maintenance for themselves and
families; (9) those who are engaged in representing publicly
or privately, for fee or reward, without license, any
tragedy, interlude, comedy, farce, play, or other similar
entertainment, exhibition of the circus, sleight-of-hand,
waxworks, or the like; (10) those who, for private gain,
without license, give any concert or musical entertainment,
of any description; (11) fortune tellers; (12) sturdy beggars;
(13) common drunkards; (14) those who hunt game
of any description, or fish on the land of others or frequent
the premises, contrary to the will of the occupants. That
the South Carolina legislature had the Negro primarily in
mind is shown by the fact that this section is included in
the act “to establish and regulate the domestic relations of
persons of color and to amend the law in relation to paupers
and vagrancy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mississippi<a id='r114' /><a href='#f114' class='c014'><sup>[114]</sup></a> had a vagrancy list almost as extensive
as that above with the addition that any freedmen, free
Negroes, or mulattoes over eighteen years of age, found on
the second Monday in January, 1866, or thereafter, with
no lawful employment or business, or found unlawfully
assembling themselves together in the day or night time,
and white persons “so assembling with freedmen, free
Negroes, or mulattoes&nbsp;... on terms of equality, or living
in adultery or fornication with a freedwoman, free Negro,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>or mulatto,” should be considered vagrants. The white
man so convicted was punishable by a fine of two hundred
dollars and imprisonment for not more than six months;
the Negro, by a fine of fifty dollars and imprisonment for
not over ten days. A Negro unable to pay his fine might
be hired out for the purpose, but no such provision applied
to whites.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>PAUPER LAWS</h3>

<p class='c012'>Another perplexing problem that faced the Southern
legislatures was how to meet the needs of the paupers,
white and Negro. Much of the property of the white people
had been swept away entirely or had greatly deteriorated
in value as a result of the War. Few of the Negroes,
to be sure, had property to lose, but what was worse, they
had lost their right to look to the white people for sustenance.
Many of them were unable to support themselves,
and the white people could not help them. The legislatures,
therefore, adopted the plan of levying a tax upon
each race for the support of its own indigents. South
Carolina and Mississippi again took the lead.</p>

<p class='c007'>In South Carolina,<a id='r115' /><a href='#f115' class='c014'><sup>[115]</sup></a> when a person of color was unable
to earn his support and was likely to become a public
charge, the father and grandfathers, mother and grandmothers,
child and grandchildren, brother and sister of
such a person should each according to ability contribute
for the support of his or her relative. In each judicial district
there was a “Board of Relief of Indigent Persons of
Color,” consisting of from four to eight magistrates, each
magistrate looking after the indigent Negroes in his precinct.
There was a fund, composed of fees paid for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>approval of contracts for service, instruments of apprenticeship,
licenses, fines, penalties, forfeitures, and wages of
convicts, for the relief of indigent Negroes. If this fund
was insufficient, the board might impose a tax of one dollar
upon all male persons of color between eighteen and fifty,
and fifty cents upon each female between eighteen and
forty-five. This tax had to be paid on the day fixed or the
person rendered himself liable to pay a double tax. It was
the duty of every occupant of premises to make a report
to the magistrate of any indigent colored person thereon,
and the magistrate had to make inquiry into the condition
and wants of such Negroes so reported. Moreover, the
magistrate had to make a semiannual report of the condition
of such Negroes to the chairman of the Board of Relief.
The machinery for taking care of Negro paupers was
worked out in more detail than it would be profitable to go
into here.</p>

<p class='c007'>South Carolina made also these very humane provisions:
Where, upon any farm or lands, there were, on December
21, 1865, persons of color who were formerly the
slaves of the owner, lessee, or occupant of the farm or
lands present there on November 10, 1865, and had been
there six months previous, helpless, either from old age,
infancy, disease, or other cause, and unable to maintain
themselves and had no parent or other relative able to maintain
them or to provide other houses or quarters, it was
not lawful for the present or any subsequent owner, lessee,
or occupant before January 1, 1867, to evict such helpless
person of color, under penalty of a fine of fifty dollars, or
imprisonment of one month.</p>

<p class='c007'>The law of Mississippi<a id='r116' /><a href='#f116' class='c014'><sup>[116]</sup></a> provided that the same liabilities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>should rest on Negroes to support their indigents as
upon white persons to support theirs. It levied a tax of
one dollar upon every freedman, free Negro, or mulatto
between eighteen and sixty to go into the Freedmen’s Pauper
Fund. If a Negro refused to pay the tax, he might be
arrested and hired out till he had worked out the amount.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Southern States between 1865 and 1868 passed
many statutes relative to the marital relations of Negroes
and to their right to testify in court. But these statutes
are to be discussed in later chapters. It may be said, however,
in passing, that the district judge, so often referred
to in connection with the South Carolina laws, was a special
officer whose main duty was to preside over cases and disputes
to which Negroes were parties.</p>

<p class='c007'>This chapter has been confined to the early industrial
distinctions between the races—that is, to those laws which
related to the rights of the Negro as a bread-winner. These
are the distinctions brought forward by those who believed
in radical reconstruction measures in the South, as an argument
for their position. It was urged by such that, unless
Congress stepped in and took a hand, the Southern States
would reënslave the Negro: they pointed particularly to the
laws of Mississippi and South Carolina in confirmation of
their contention. And there was apparently good ground
for such a view. The laws providing that colored laborers
should be called servants and their employers masters, that
they should arise at a certain time and work so many hours
per day, that they could not leave the premises or receive
visitors without the master’s consent, and the like, sounded
very much like prescribing the duties and privileges of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>slave. But, on the other hand, many of the requirements
were for the protection of the Negro. Such, for instance,
were the statutes requiring contracts for service to be in
writing and the terms of them explained to the Negro; that
helpless ex-slaves should not be evicted from their old
homes within two years from January 1, 1865; that Negro
paupers should be cared for; and that the master must
teach his apprentice to read and write, must give him good
food and clothing, and treat him humanely.</p>

<p class='c007'>A discussion, however, of the merits of these early laws
is out of place here. But it is only fair to remember, in
reading them, that the Southern legislatures were, in many
instances, only following precedents that had been set by
the free States in dealing with free Negroes, and that the
States, either Northern or Southern, had not yet looked
upon the Negro as a citizen with the rights guaranteed him
by the amended Federal Constitution. Industrial conditions
in the South were so demoralized by the War and
Emancipation that the legislatures considered it imperative
upon them to take immediate and positive steps to establish
an industrial relation between the races.</p>

<p class='c007'>Practically all of these laws were repealed or became
dead letters as soon as the Fourteenth Amendment was
passed or, at least, as soon as the government of the Southern
States went into the hands of the Reconstructionists.
But they are still interesting historically as having furnished
an argument for the radical régime of Reconstruction
which Thaddeus Stevens and his supporters inaugurated
and advanced.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>RECONSTRUCTION OF MARITAL RELATIONS OF NEGROES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>One of the perplexing problems that arose out of
Emancipation was the fixing of the marital relations among
Negroes. It is generally known that the marriage ties between
slaves were loose and their domestic relations irregular.
In some instances, slave marriages were solemnized
according to legal requirements, by either a white clergyman
or other proper officer of the law; in others, there was
the common law marriage—that is, the parties lived together
as husband and wife under a simple, unrecorded
agreement between themselves; in still other instances,
there was deplorable promiscuity.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Negro was made a citizen, it became necessary
at once to settle his marital relations. If the usual
slave marriages were not recognized as legal, then the offspring
of such unions were bastards with the usual disqualifications
of that class, among which is their partial incapacity
to inherit property. In order to secure to Negroes
the rights of heirs, it was necessary to legalize slave marriages,
at least to the extent of giving to the children of
such marriages the right of inheritance. This was accomplished
in one of three ways. Some States required the
emancipated slaves to be remarried in order to legitimate
their offspring; others required them to appear before an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>officer, declare their desire to continue to live together, and
get a certificate; others still, and these were in the majority,
passed statutes legalizing all slave marriages. A few
States did not adopt any one of these three methods but
left it to the courts to recognize the legality of such marriages
as cases arose.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>REMARRIAGES</h3>

<p class='c012'>Among the States which adopted the method of remarrying
was Florida,<a id='r117' /><a href='#f117' class='c014'><sup>[117]</sup></a> which, by a law of 1866, required all
colored persons living together as husband and wife, who
had not been legally married, and who wished to continue
so to live together, to be married within nine months from
the passage of the statute on January 11th. If they failed
to be married but continued to live together, they were punished
as guilty of fornication and adultery. By the second
marriage, their children were legitimated. The law made
it incumbent upon the clerk of the court, upon application
by the parties and a tender of the required fee, to enter a
certificate of marriage upon his register. Anyone practicing
fraud upon Negroes by pretending to perform the marriage
ceremony without authority to do so was guilty of a
misdemeanor and punishable by a fine not exceeding one
thousand dollars, imprisonment not over six months, or
might be sentenced to stand in a pillory not over one hour.
After the expiration of the nine months named in the statute,
the marriage requirements for white and colored persons
were the same. This statute of 1866<a id='r118' /><a href='#f118' class='c014'><sup>[118]</sup></a> was amended,
on December 14, of the same year, to the effect that, if persons
of color had lived together as husband and wife and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>had recognized each other as such, they were to be considered
married and their children to be legitimate. Thus, the
necessity of a remarriage was obviated. The amendment
was added apparently because of the great number of indictments
for adultery against those who had not complied
with the law of January 11th.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Georgia<a id='r119' /><a href='#f119' class='c014'><sup>[119]</sup></a> Constitution of 1865 directed the General
Assembly at its next session to pass a law to legalize the
existing slave marriages and to provide for the contracting
and solemnizing of future marriages and, in connection
with this, to define and regulate the Negro’s right to devise
and inherit property. The General Assembly<a id='r120' /><a href='#f120' class='c014'><sup>[120]</sup></a> responded
in 1866 by enacting a statute by which persons of color then
living together as husband and wife were declared to be
so. If the man had two reputed wives or the wife two reputed
husbands, he or she must select one of the two as
wife or husband, with her or his consent, and have the
ceremony of marriage performed. If they continued to
cohabit without making this choice, they were guilty of
fornication and adultery. It was not enough to make the
selection and live faithful to the one chosen; the marriage
ceremony was a requisite.<a id='r121' /><a href='#f121' class='c014'><sup>[121]</sup></a> Unless there were two reputed
husbands or wives, the ceremony was not necessary.<a id='r122' /><a href='#f122' class='c014'><sup>[122]</sup></a> By
the same act<a id='r123' /><a href='#f123' class='c014'><sup>[123]</sup></a> the children of slave marriages were legitimated,
and Negro ministers were given a similar right to
perform marriage ceremonies for Negroes as white ministers
had for both races.</p>

<p class='c007'>Missouri,<a id='r124' /><a href='#f124' class='c014'><sup>[124]</sup></a> in 1865, required all persons of color claiming
to be married and wishing to continue in that relation
to appear before some one authorized to perform the ceremony
and be joined in marriage.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>The same year, South Carolina<a id='r125' /><a href='#f125' class='c014'><sup>[125]</sup></a> passed a statute of
ninety-nine sections relative to persons of color, eleven of
which concerned their marital relations. This statute established
the relation of husband and wife between persons
of color, and declared that those then living as such were
husband and wife. If a man had two or more reputed
wives or a woman two or more reputed husbands, he or she
must choose one of them by April 1, 1866, and be remarried.
Children born before the enactment of this law were
declared to be the legitimate offspring of their mother, and
of their putative father also if they were acknowledged by
him. Thereafter, Negroes must be married as white people
were—by a clergyman, judge, magistrate, or other judicial
officer. The husband who abandoned his wife or the
wife who abandoned her husband, might be bound out
from year to year until he or she was willing to resume
conjugal relations. An abandoned wife was free to make
a contract for service. South Carolina has been apparently
the only State to provide for the children of white
fathers and Negro mothers. A law<a id='r126' /><a href='#f126' class='c014'><sup>[126]</sup></a> of 1872 declared
that such children might inherit from their father if he
did not marry another woman but continued to live with
their mother.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>CERTIFICATES OF MARRIAGE</h3>

<p class='c012'>Kentucky, Louisiana, and Maryland provided for the
marriage of former slaves by the second method enumerated
above, the granting of certificates. The Kentucky
law<a id='r127' /><a href='#f127' class='c014'><sup>[127]</sup></a> declared that all colored persons who had been living
together as husband and wife and who continued to do
so should be regarded as legally married and their children
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>legitimate. But the man and woman must appear before
the clerk of the county court and declare that they had
been living and wished to continue to live as husband and
wife. Upon payment of fifty cents, the clerk recorded the
declaration, and for twenty-five cents more issued a certificate
thereof to the parties. It was not a sufficient compliance
with the statute for the parties to continue to live together
without appearing before the clerk of the court.<a id='r128' /><a href='#f128' class='c014'><sup>[128]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>An interesting case<a id='r129' /><a href='#f129' class='c014'><sup>[129]</sup></a> which arose under this Kentucky
statute was as follows: A Negro woman, an ex-slave and
living as the wife of another ex-slave, made her promissory
note between the time of her emancipation and the date of
this law. Under the provision of the statute, the man and
woman appeared before the clerk of the court and obtained
a marriage certificate. Later, she was sued on the note
and pleaded coverture. At that time a married woman
could not make a valid contract in her own name. The
court held the plea bad, being of opinion that, as between
the parties to the marriage, the statute validated their
union from the beginning, but as to third parties, the
woman was still single and so capable of making a valid
contract.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1895, the same court<a id='r130' /><a href='#f130' class='c014'><sup>[130]</sup></a> held that, if a Negro man and
woman lived together while slaves as husband and wife, a
customary marriage was established, the court saying in its
opinion: “Since the passage of the Act of February, 1866,&nbsp;... the general tendency of the decisions of this court has
been to give that Act of 1866 a liberal construction with a
view to effectuate its clearly defined purpose.” And a late
statute<a id='r131' /><a href='#f131' class='c014'><sup>[131]</sup></a> of 1898 further modified the law of 1866 by declaring
that the children of above marriages might inherit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>property. If there was a subsequent marriage and children
born of it, the slave children shared with them <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro rata</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>A statute of Louisiana,<a id='r132' /><a href='#f132' class='c014'><sup>[132]</sup></a> in 1868, legalized all private
or religious marriages, provided that the parties, within
two years, made a declaration of their marriage before a
notary public or other competent officer, giving the date
of the marriage and the number and ages of the children.
Though the statute did not mention Negroes, it must have
been passed for their benefit.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1873, the following case<a id='r133' /><a href='#f133' class='c014'><sup>[133]</sup></a> came before the Louisiana
court: A Negro’s parents, who had lived together as husband
and wife, died before Emancipation. The majority of
the court held that, if they had lived till after Emancipation,
their children would have been capable of inheriting
their property, but, since they died before Emancipation,
their marriage was never legalized, and their offspring
could not so inherit. The dissenting opinion was that,
since the slaves had done all they could to be legally married,
they should be recognized as married and their children
should be legitimated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Maryland,<a id='r134' /><a href='#f134' class='c014'><sup>[134]</sup></a> in 1867, confirmed and made valid all previous
marriages between colored persons, but required them
to prove before a justice of the peace that they had been so
married; and a certificate to that effect had to be filed with
the clerk of the court. Thereafter, colored persons must
secure licenses and be married in the same manner as white
people.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>SLAVE MARRIAGES DECLARED LEGAL BY STATUTE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The last of the three methods of reconstructing the
domestic relations of former slaves was by declaring slave
marriages legal by statute. On September 29, 1866, the
Constitutional Convention of Alabama, which adopted an
ordinance prohibiting slavery, also enacted<a id='r135' /><a href='#f135' class='c014'><sup>[135]</sup></a> that all marriages
between freedmen and freedwomen, whether during
slavery or after, solemnized by one having or claiming
to have the authority, should be valid, if the parties
were still living together. It was subsequently held that,
under this act, the woman had a right of dower, although
the man had abandoned her and married another woman
within a month after such act was passed.<a id='r136' /><a href='#f136' class='c014'><sup>[136]</sup></a> In 1870, the
Supreme Court of the State held that the children of slave
marriages were not bastards, that by the elevation of their
parents to citizenship, their heritable blood was restored.<a id='r137' /><a href='#f137' class='c014'><sup>[137]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Arkansas,<a id='r138' /><a href='#f138' class='c014'><sup>[138]</sup></a> in 1866, legalized marriages of all persons
of color who then lived together as husband and wife and
made their children legitimate, but provided that thereafter
all marriages of persons of color must be recorded. The
same year Tennessee<a id='r139' /><a href='#f139' class='c014'><sup>[139]</sup></a> passed a similar statute.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Constitution<a id='r140' /><a href='#f140' class='c014'><sup>[140]</sup></a> of Texas of 1869 declared that all
persons should be considered legally married who in slavery
lived as husband and wife and after Emancipation
either continued to live together till one died or were living
together at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.
Such a marriage completed by cohabitation after Emancipation
was valid, though the parties separated within five
months and were not living together at the time of the
adoption of the Constitution.<a id='r141' /><a href='#f141' class='c014'><sup>[141]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>The law of Virginia<a id='r142' /><a href='#f142' class='c014'><sup>[142]</sup></a> provided that persons of color
living as husband and wife on February 27, 1866, whether
or not any ceremony had been performed, should be considered
as lawfully married and their children legitimate. If
they had separated prior to that date the children of the
woman, if recognized by the man to be his, were nevertheless
legitimate. West Virginia<a id='r143' /><a href='#f143' class='c014'><sup>[143]</sup></a> had practically the same
law, except the latter clause about recognition by the father.</p>

<p class='c007'>Illinois,<a id='r144' /><a href='#f144' class='c014'><sup>[144]</sup></a> as late as 1891, passed a statute to legalize
slave marriages and legitimate the children thereof. But
this law did not apply to a voidable slave marriage in another
State, disaffirmed by a subsequent legal marriage
before the enactment of the statute.<a id='r145' /><a href='#f145' class='c014'><sup>[145]</sup></a> A similar decision
under a similar statute was rendered in Ohio<a id='r146' /><a href='#f146' class='c014'><sup>[146]</sup></a> in 1883.
These decisions would indicate that a slave marriage was
valid only if there was no subsequent marriage of either
party to a third person. In 1876, New York<a id='r147' /><a href='#f147' class='c014'><sup>[147]</sup></a> recognized
as valid slave marriages contracted in slave States
with the consent of the master.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>MARRIAGES BETWEEN SLAVES AND FREE NEGROES</h3>

<p class='c012'>Statutes relative to marriages between free Negroes and
slaves are not numerous. Presumably, the term “persons
of color” included both Negroes born free and those who
had been slaves. A Tennessee court,<a id='r148' /><a href='#f148' class='c014'><sup>[148]</sup></a> in 1882, held that
the formal marriage of a free Negro and a slave, with the
consent of the master, followed by a cohabitation for years,
was a valid marriage and entitled the woman to dower.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>FEDERAL LEGISLATION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Congress of the United States has had occasion to
pass upon the validity of slave marriages only in connection
with pensions to the descendants of colored soldiers.
An act<a id='r149' /><a href='#f149' class='c014'><sup>[149]</sup></a> of 1873 provided that, in determining whether the
widow of a Negro or Indian soldier and sailor is entitled
to a pension, it is necessary only for the claimants to show
that she was married according to some ceremony, which
she and the deceased deemed obligatory, that they habitually
recognized each other as husband and wife, and were
so recognized by their neighbors, and that they lived together
up to the date of his enlistment. It was also provided
that the children of such marriages might claim
their father’s pension.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though they proceeded in different ways, practically
all of the States arrived at the same result. If slaves were
married according to the custom, if they lived as husband
and wife both before and after Emancipation, their union
was considered a valid marriage to all intents and purposes
and the children thereof might inherit. Where the procurement
of a certificate or remarriage was required, if one of
the parties took advantage of the opportunity to be freed
from the early alliance, as happened in several amusing instances,
and took another spouse, the second marriage was
the valid one, and the children of the slave union could not
inherit their parents’ property.</p>

<p class='c007'>It scarcely needs to add that, at present, the marriage
requirements as to license, age, etc., are in all States precisely
the same both for white and colored people.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>INTERMARRIAGE AND MISCEGENATION</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>One race distinction, which has not been confined to the
South, and which has, in a large measure, escaped the adverse
criticism heaped upon other race distinctions is the
prohibition of miscegenation between the Caucasian and
the colored races. The term “miscegenation” includes
both intermarriage and all forms of illicit intercourse between
the races. Twenty-six States and Territories, including
all the Southern States, have laws forbidding the
admixture of the races; applying not only to Negroes, but
also to Indians and Mongolians in States where the latter
races are present in considerable numbers.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>INTERMARRIAGE DURING RECONSTRUCTION</h3>

<p class='c012'>It is significant that during the years of Reconstruction
in the South, when the Federal and State governments
were endeavoring to eradicate race distinctions, none of the
statutes against miscegenation appear to have been repealed.
There is some meager authority—a case which arose in
Tennessee<a id='r150' /><a href='#f150' class='c014'><sup>[150]</sup></a> in 1872, and two cases in North Carolina<a id='r151' /><a href='#f151' class='c014'><sup>[151]</sup></a> in
1877—which might tend to show that the statutes of two
Southern States were repealed. The Tennessee court was
of opinion that intermarriage was not prohibited in Mississippi,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>and the North Carolina courts arrived at the same
conclusion about South Carolina; but neither court specified
the years to which its statement applied, and a careful
examination of the annual laws of Mississippi and South
Carolina between 1865 and 1880 reveals no statutes repealing
the laws against intermarriage in those States. One is
led to conclude, therefore, that the statutes against miscegenation
were disregarded in a few instances during Reconstruction,
rather than repealed. This conclusion is
helped out by the fact that the legislatures manifested no
inclination to permit miscegenation. The legislature of
South Carolina,<a id='r152' /><a href='#f152' class='c014'><sup>[152]</sup></a> for instance, in 1865, before the State
government went into the hands of the Reconstructionists,
enacted laws, covering twenty-five or more finely printed
pages, defining the rights of Negroes in the most minute
details, as was seen in considering the “Black Laws” of
1865–68. These laws were repealed nine months later, but
the legislature was careful to add that the repealing act did
not apply to that part of the Act of 1865 which said that
marriage between a white person and a person of color
should be illegal and void. The legislature of Texas,<a id='r153' /><a href='#f153' class='c014'><sup>[153]</sup></a> in
like manner, on November 10, 1866, repealed most of its
statutes relating to free Negroes, but added that nothing
in the act should be construed to repeal any laws prohibiting
intermarriage of the white and black races. The repealing
statute of Arkansas<a id='r154' /><a href='#f154' class='c014'><sup>[154]</sup></a> of February 6, 1867, made
practically the same exception as to intermarriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Determined as many of the Reconstruction promoters
were to wipe out every vestige of legally recognized race
distinctions, they did not allow their zeal to carry them
to the extent of legislating as to the social relations of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>races. Georgia, probably fearing that some legislature
might attempt to enact such measures, in its Constitutions
of 1868<a id='r155' /><a href='#f155' class='c014'><sup>[155]</sup></a> and 1877<a id='r156' /><a href='#f156' class='c014'><sup>[156]</sup></a> had this general statement: “The
social status of the citizen shall never be the subject of legislation.”
It would seem, on first thought, that this requirement
would defeat its own purpose. If marriage is a
social status and if legislation as to the social status of the
citizen is forever prohibited, how can a law prohibiting
intermarriage be constitutional? In a test case<a id='r157' /><a href='#f157' class='c014'><sup>[157]</sup></a> that arose
in 1869 the Supreme Court of the State very neatly explained
away this apparently embarrassing situation by
saying, in effect, that the clause in the Constitution applied
only to future legislation, and it did not affect the law prohibiting
intermarriage then in force. After quoting that
clause in the Constitution, the court went on to say:
“In so far as the marriage relation is connected with the
social <em>status</em>, the very reverse is true. That section of the
Constitution forever prohibits legislation of any character
regulating or interfering with the social status. It leaves
social rights and <em>status</em> where it finds them. It prohibits
the legislature from repealing any laws in existence, which
protect persons in the free regulation among themselves of
matters properly termed social, and it also prohibits the
enactment of any new laws on that subject in the future.”
The Constitution of Alabama<a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a> of 1901 provides against
possible meddling by the legislature with domestic relations
in more outspoken terms: “The legislature shall
never pass any law to authorize or legalize any marriage
between any white person and a Negro or descendant of a
Negro.”</p>

  <h3 class='c013'>PRESENT STATE OF THE LAW AGAINST INTERMARRIAGE</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The present situation as regards intermarriage is as follows:
Intermarriage between the Caucasian and other races
is prohibited by the Constitutions of six States, all Southern,
namely: Alabama,<a id='r158' /><a href='#f158' class='c014'><sup>[158]</sup></a> Florida,<a id='r159' /><a href='#f159' class='c014'><sup>[159]</sup></a> Mississippi,<a id='r160' /><a href='#f160' class='c014'><sup>[160]</sup></a> North

is prohibited by statute also in the above States
and in twenty other States and Territories, namely: Alabama,<a id='r164' /><a href='#f164' class='c014'><sup>[164]</sup></a>

<h3 class='c013'>TO WHOM THE LAWS APPLY</h3>

<p class='c012'>In the interpretation of these statutes against intermarriage,
it is necessary, at the outset, to determine just
who are included. If the statutes had simply enacted that
there should be no intermarriage between Caucasians, on the
one side, and Negroes, Indians, or Mongolians, on the other,
they would have left the great body of mixed-blooded people
to miscegenate as they pleased. Most of the States avoided
this difficulty by stating clearly to whom the laws apply.
Virginia and Louisiana are the only States simply to
enact in general terms that there shall be no intermarriage
between white persons and persons of color; and even in
Virginia judicial decisions clearly define the term “person
of color,” so there is no difficulty in knowing who is meant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>by the statute. Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware, Idaho, and
Kentucky prohibit intermarriage between white persons
and Negroes or mulattoes. Georgia, Texas, and Oklahoma
place within the prohibition of their statutes persons of
African descent; West Virginia, Negroes; and Florida,
Negroes, expressly including every person with one-eighth
or more of Negro blood. Alabama makes its law apply to
Negroes and their descendants to the fifth generation,
though one ancestor of each generation was white. The
Indiana and Missouri statutes extend to all persons having
one-eighth or more Negro blood; Maryland to Negroes or
persons of Negro descent to the third generation inclusive.
Tennessee includes within the prohibition Negroes, mulattoes,
or persons of mixed blood descended from a Negro to
the third generation inclusive. The Nebraska law applies
to persons of one-fourth or more Negro blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The States which have a large Indian or Mongolian
population include these races within the prohibition.
Thus, Arizona prohibits whites to intermarry with Negroes,
Mongolians, or Indians and their descendants; California,
with Negroes, Mongolians, or Indians and their descendants;
California, with Negroes, Mongolians, or mulattoes.
It is interesting to note that the word “Mongolian”
was not added to the California statute<a id='r190' /><a href='#f190' class='c014'><sup>[190]</sup></a> till 1905. This
addition, coming, as it does, so nearly contemporaneous
with the school trouble in San Francisco, is evidence that
California is facing a race problem which it considers serious.
The Mississippi law applies to Negroes, mulattoes,
persons who have one-eighth or more Negro blood, Mongolians
or persons who have one-eighth or more Mongolian
blood. Nevada includes black persons, mulattoes, Indians,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Chinese; Oregon, in addition to Negroes, prohibits intermarriage
with Chinese and with persons having one-fourth
or more Negro, Chinese, or Kanaka blood or having more
than one-half Indian blood. Utah includes simply Negroes
and Mongolians; North Carolina, Negroes and Indians.
South Carolina prohibits intermarriage between whites and
Indians, Negroes, mulattoes, mestizoes, or half-breeds.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>EFFECT OF ATTEMPTED INTERMARRIAGE</h3>

<p class='c012'>Suppose a white person and a person within any of the
prohibited classes do attempt to intermarry. What is the
legal result? Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska,
North Carolina, and Utah declare that such a marriage is
void; Colorado, Missouri, and Virginia, that it is absolutely
void; Arizona, Georgia, Oregon, and Tennessee, that it is
null and void; Delaware and Mississippi, that it is unlawful
and void; and Arkansas, California, and Idaho, that it
is illegal and void. The law of Florida declares that such a
marriage is unlawful, utterly null and void and the issue
bastards and so incapable of inheriting. Louisiana provides
that such a marriage is prohibited, the celebration of
it forbidden, that the celebration carries with it no effect,
and that the marriage is null and void. South Carolina
enacts that it is “utterly null and void and of none effect.”
The only legal effect of a marriage thus declared void is to
impose criminal liability upon the parties to it. The result
is precisely the same as if no license had been obtained
or ceremony performed and the parties had been indulging
in illicit relations. A Virginia decision says: “No matter
by what ceremonies or solemnities, such marriage would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>have been the merest nullity, and the parties must have
been regarded under our laws, as lewdly associating and cohabiting
together....”<a id='r191' /><a href='#f191' class='c014'><sup>[191]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The other States which prohibit intermarriage simply
declare that marriage between white persons and Negroes
is illegal and prescribe a punishment for the violation of
the statute against miscegenation, but do not further define
the legal effect of such a marriage contract. But whether
the marriage is declared “void” or “null and void” or
“absolutely void” or only “illegal,” the result is the same.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>PUNISHMENT FOR INTERMARRIAGE</h3>

<p class='c012'>Persons of different races who attempt to intermarry in
violation of the laws subject themselves everywhere to
severe penalties. In Alabama, the law says they shall be
imprisoned in the penitentiary for not less than two, nor
more than seven years. In Colorado, they are guilty of
a misdemeanor and punishable by a fine of from fifty dollars
to five hundred dollars, or imprisonment for not less
than three months nor more than two years, or both. In
Delaware, they are guilty of a misdemeanor and may be
fined one hundred dollars. Florida says they shall be imprisoned
in the State penitentiary not exceeding ten years
or fined not exceeding one thousand dollars. In Indiana,
if they knowingly violate the law—that is, if the white
person knows the other is a Negro or of mixed blood—they
are fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than
one thousand dollars, or imprisoned in the State prison
not less than one nor more than ten years. Maryland declares
that they are guilty of an infamous crime, punishable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>by imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than
eighteen months nor more than ten years. Mississippi
makes the punishment a fine of five hundred dollars, imprisonment
not exceeding ten years, or both. The law of
Missouri declares that one who knowingly intermarries in
violation of the statute shall be punished by imprisonment
in the penitentiary two years or by a fine not less than
one hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the county
jail not less than three months, or by both such fine and
imprisonment, and adds that the jury shall determine
the amount of Negro blood by appearance. Nevada enacts
that the parties are guilty of a misdemeanor and shall
be imprisoned in the State prison not less than one nor
more than two years. North Carolina brands an attempted
intermarriage as an infamous crime to be punished by
imprisonment in the county jail or State prison not less
than four months nor more than ten years, and the parties
may also be fined at the discretion of the court. Oklahoma
makes it a felony and provides that the parties shall
be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred dollars
nor more than five hundred dollars or imprisonment
not less than thirty days nor more than one year, or both.
Oregon simply makes it an offence punishable by imprisonment
in the penitentiary or county jail between three
months and one year. South Carolina<a id='r192' /><a href='#f192' class='c014'><sup>[192]</sup></a> declares attempted
intermarriage is a misdemeanor punishable by
a fine of not less than five hundred dollars or imprisonment
in the penitentiary from one to five years. Texas, by a
law of 1858, still in force in 1879, prescribed a punishment
for the white person who attempted to marry a
Negro but no punishment for the Negro. A Federal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>court<a id='r193' /><a href='#f193' class='c014'><sup>[193]</sup></a> held that the difference of punishment was in violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment, but that the law
against intermarriage was constitutional. Virginia provides
that the parties shall be confined in the penitentiary
not less than two nor more than five years. West Virginia
would confine them in jail not over one year and
fine them not exceeding one hundred dollars. Thus, it
appears that in most of the States intermarriage is considered
a very serious offence, ranking in Colorado, Delaware,
Nevada, and South Carolina, as a misdemeanor; in
Louisiana and North Carolina as an infamous crime; and
in Tennessee and Oklahoma as a felony.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>PUNISHMENT FOR ISSUING LICENSES</h3>

<p class='c012'>With no less severity do the States punish those who issue
licenses to persons of one race to marry those of another.
Alabama declares that anyone knowingly issuing
a license for the marriage of a white and colored person
shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more
than one thousand dollars and may also be imprisoned
in the county jail or sentenced to hard labor for the county
for not more than six months. Colorado makes it a misdemeanor
punishable by a fine of one hundred dollars. Florida
punishes it by imprisonment not exceeding two years
or a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars. North Carolina
simply declares it to be a misdemeanor without prescribing
any punishment different from that for other
misdemeanors. Oklahoma makes it a misdemeanor punishable
by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more
than five hundred dollars, or imprisonment in the county
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>jail not less than thirty days nor more than one year, or
both.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>PUNISHMENT FOR PERFORMING THE CEREMONY</h3>

<p class='c012'>A heavy penalty is laid also upon one who performs
the ceremony for those who marry in violation of the laws
against miscegenation. Alabama provides that any justice
of the peace, minister, or other person, who knowingly
performs the marriage ceremony between a white and
colored person, shall be fined not less than one hundred
dollars nor more than one thousand and, at the discretion
of the court, imprisoned in the country jail or sentenced
to hard labor for the county for not more than six months.
Arkansas makes anyone performing such a ceremony guilty
of a high misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not less
than one hundred dollars. Colorado declares that to perform
the ceremony is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine
of between fifty dollars and five hundred dollars or imprisonment
between three months and two years, or both.
In Delaware, it is a misdemeanor, and the punishment is
a one hundred dollar fine. Florida either imprisons the
person performing the ceremony not over one year or imposes
a fine on him not exceeding one thousand dollars.
North Carolina simply defines it as a misdemeanor. Indiana
declares that one who knowingly counsels or assists
in such a marriage shall be fined not less than one hundred
dollars nor more than one thousand dollars. Nevada
makes one who performs the ceremony guilty of a misdemeanor
and subjects him to imprisonment in the State
prison not less than one year nor more than three years.
Oklahoma makes it a misdemeanor and imposes a fine of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>between one hundred dollars and five hundred dollars, or
imprisonment between three months and a year, or both.
The law of Oregon declares that one who wilfully and
knowingly performs such marriage ceremony shall be imprisoned
in the penitentiary or county jail from three
months to one year and fined from one hundred dollars to
one thousand dollars. South Carolina provides that one
who knowingly and willingly unites persons of different
races in the bonds of matrimony shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
and punished by a fine of not less than five hundred
dollars nor more than twelve months’ imprisonment,
or both. Virginia declares that he shall forfeit two hundred
dollars, of which the informant shall get one-half;
and West Virginia provides that the one who knowingly
performs the ceremony shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
and fined not over two hundred dollars.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>COHABITATION WITHOUT INTERMARRIAGE</h3>

<p class='c012'>A few States have statutes relative to illicit relations
between white and colored persons, where no marriage is
pretended to exist. Alabama imposes for this offence upon
both man and woman the same punishment as for intermarriage;
a living together in adultery one day with intent
to continue that relation has been held to constitute
a violation of the statute.<a id='r194' /><a href='#f194' class='c014'><sup>[194]</sup></a> Florida declares that, if any
white person and Negro or mulatto shall live together in
adultery or fornication with each other, each shall be punished
by imprisonment not exceeding a year, or by a fine
not exceeding a thousand dollars. The law adds that any
Negro man and white woman or any white man and Negro
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>woman, not married to each other, who habitually live in
and occupy in the night-time the same room, no other person
over fifteen years of age being present, shall be punished
by imprisonment not exceeding twelve months, or
by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars. Nevada provides
that, if any white person shall live and cohabit with
any black person, mulatto, Indian, or Chinese, in a state
of fornication, such person so offending shall be fined not
over five hundred and not less than one hundred dollars,
or imprisonment in the county jail between one and six
months, or both. Louisiana<a id='r195' /><a href='#f195' class='c014'><sup>[195]</sup></a> has the most recent and the
most thorough-going statute against miscegenation; it was
adopted July 1, 1908. It provides that concubinage between
a white person and a Negro is a felony, punishable
by imprisonment for not less than one month nor more
than one year. Concubinage is defined as unlawful cohabitation
of white persons and Negroes whether open or
secret. It was made the duty of the judges to specially
charge the grand juries upon this statute.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most interesting feature about these statutes is
that they impose a heavier penalty for cohabitation between
a white and a colored person than between two members
of the same race. Yet they have been held to comply with
the Constitution of the United States. The reasons why
such statutes are held to be constitutional will be considered
later.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>STATES REPEALING LAWS AGAINST INTERMARRIAGE</h3>

<p class='c012'>Only five States that once had laws against miscegenation
have repealed them since 1865. New Mexico,<a id='r196' /><a href='#f196' class='c014'><sup>[196]</sup></a> in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>1866, Rhode Island,<a id='r197' /><a href='#f197' class='c014'><sup>[197]</sup></a> in 1881, and Maine,<a id='r198' /><a href='#f198' class='c014'><sup>[198]</sup></a> in 1883, repealed
their laws against intermarriage outright. A
statute of Michigan<a id='r199' /><a href='#f199' class='c014'><sup>[199]</sup></a> in 1883 provided that all marriages
theretofore contracted between white persons and those
wholly or in part of African descent should be valid and
effectual and the offspring legitimate, but it said nothing
about marriages contracted in the future. Professor Frederick
J. Stimson<a id='r200' /><a href='#f200' class='c014'><sup>[200]</sup></a> has apparently interpreted the statute
to apply to marriages in the future as well as to those
already contracted. Finally, Ohio<a id='r201' /><a href='#f201' class='c014'><sup>[201]</sup></a> in 1887 repealed its
law of 1877, providing for the punishment of persons of
“pure white blood” who intermarry or have carnal intercourse
with any Negro or person having a distinct and
visible admixture of African blood.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>MARRIAGES BETWEEN THE NEGRO AND NON-CAUCASIAN RACES</h3>

<p class='c012'>It is significant that the States have not prohibited intermarriage
between two different races except where one
is the Caucasian. In no State is it unlawful for Mongolians
and Indians, Negroes and Mongolians, or Negroes
and Indians to intermarry. The only exception to the last
is that in North Carolina<a id='r202' /><a href='#f202' class='c014'><sup>[202]</sup></a> it is unlawful for Negroes to
intermarry with Croatan Indians or to go to the same
school with them. To this statute hangs a beautiful historical
tradition. In 1585, the date of the first attempt
by Englishmen to colonize the New World, there was an
island off the coast of North Carolina called Croatoan.
By the shifting of the sands, it is now probably a part
of Hatteras or Ocracoke Island. In 1587, a colony of one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>hundred and seventy-seven persons under John White was
landed by Sir Walter Raleigh on this island. Here, the
same year, was born Virginia Dare, granddaughter of John
White and the first child of English parents born in America.
Later, part of the colonists under White had to go
back to England to seek further aid. By agreement, those
left behind were to go over to the friendly Croatoan Indians
if they needed succor. When Governor White returned
many months later, he found the settlement deserted and
carved upon a tree nearby the single word “Croatoan.”
This supposedly meant that the colonists had gone over
to the Croatoans. For some unexplained reason, the party
under White never went in search of their lost brethren.
Not a word more has ever been heard of Virginia Dare and
the others. A tradition says that they went over to the
Croatoans and eventually became absorbed into that tribe.<a id='r203' /><a href='#f203' class='c014'><sup>[203]</sup></a>
Credence is given to this by the fact that there are many
Croatoan Indians—now called Croatans—with light complexion
and blue eyes. Recently a considerable body of
mixed-blooded Indians in Robeson County, North Carolina,
have laid claim to descent from this lost colony, and
the State has officially recognized them under a separate
name as the “Croatan Indians.” Thus, all that is left of
Virginia Dare and the Lost Colony is this tradition supported
by the presence of Indians with fair skin and blue
eyes, and the statute of North Carolina that the blood of
these early settlers shall not be further adulterated, by
miscegenation, with the blood of the Negro.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>EFFECT GIVEN TO MARRIAGES IN OTHER STATES</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The next question is the interpretation of the laws
against intermarriage. What effect will a State that prohibits
miscegenation give to a marriage between a white
person and Negro in a State that permits intermarriage?
What effect, for instance, will Virginia give to a marriage
of a white woman to a Negro man contracted in Massachusetts
if the parties go to Virginia to live? If the Negro
and white woman were residents in good faith of Massachusetts
or of some State that permits intermarriage
at the time of their marriage, their marriage will, as
a general rule, be recognized as valid everywhere—even
in the Southern States. Several States, including Arkansas,
Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, and probably
others, in their statutes prohibiting intermarriage make
the provision that, if the marriage is valid where consummated,
it will be considered valid by those States. A
Tennessee<a id='r204' /><a href='#f204' class='c014'><sup>[204]</sup></a> court in 1872 did refuse to recognize as valid
a marriage celebrated in Mississippi when intermarriage
was permitted in Mississippi, but this appears to be the
only case taking that view.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, on the other hand, the parties leave a State which
prohibits intermarriage and go to another State which
allows it, solely for the purpose of evading the laws of the
former State, the authority is practically unanimous that
the marriage is not valid in the State the laws of which
they attempted to evade. This point is covered both by
statute and by judicial decision. A Delaware statute, for
instance, declares that the Negro and white person are
equally guilty if they are married in another State and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>move into Delaware as if they had been married in Delaware.
Mississippi, also, punishes parties attempting to
evade its laws by marrying out of the State and returning
to Mississippi, to the same extent as if they had
attempted to intermarry in Mississippi. The Georgia statute,
which is typical, is as follows: “All marriages solemnized
in another State by parties intending at the time
to reside in this State shall have the same legal consequences
and effect as if solemnized in this State. Parties
residing in this State cannot evade any of the provisions
of its laws as to marriage by going into another State
for the solemnization of the ceremony.” Statutes to the
same effect are in force in Arizona, Virginia, West Virginia,
and possibly other States. In the absence of statute,
the point is covered with the same result by judicial decision.
In the Tennessee case, to which reference has already
been made, the court said: “Each State is sovereign,
a government within, of, and for itself, with the
inherent and reserved right to declare and maintain its own
political economy for the good of its citizens, and cannot
be subjected to the recognition of a fact or act contravening
its public policy and against good morals, as lawful,
because it was made or existed in a State having no
prohibition against it or even promoting it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1878, a Negro man and a white woman went over
from Virginia<a id='r205' /><a href='#f205' class='c014'><sup>[205]</sup></a> into the District of Columbia, were married,
and returned to Virginia, where they were prosecuted.
The Virginia court held that, although the forms and
ceremonies of marriage are governed by the laws of the
place where marriage is celebrated, the essentials of the contract
depend upon and are governed by the laws of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>country where the parties are domiciled at the time of the
marriage, and in which the matrimonial residence is contemplated.
This case was affirmed by the Federal court<a id='r206' /><a href='#f206' class='c014'><sup>[206]</sup></a>
the next year. A Georgia<a id='r207' /><a href='#f207' class='c014'><sup>[207]</sup></a> couple who also went to the
District of Columbia to be married, returned to their native
State, where they were indicted and convicted for
violating the Georgia statute against intermarriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears that Washington has been and is the City of
Refuge for such miscegenating couples. It has been held,
however, in every case, that, when these people return to
Southern States, no matter where married, they are amenable
to the laws of those States. In fact, there appears to
be only one American case with regard to Negroes which
holds a contrary doctrine, the case of Medway v. Needham.<a id='r208' /><a href='#f208' class='c014'><sup>[208]</sup></a>
There a white person and Negro, living in Massachusetts,
which at the time, 1819, prohibited intermarriage,
went to Rhode Island, where they were married and
whence they immediately returned. The Supreme Court
of Massachusetts held that a marriage, if valid where
celebrated, is valid everywhere; the court taking no account
of the purpose of the parties to evade the law. In
rendering this decision, the Court admitted that it was
going counter to the opinion of eminent jurists. The decision
has not been followed, it appears, by any other
court. It may be taken as settled that, if the parties leave
the State for the purpose of evading its law, intending at
the time to return to that State, the marriage will not be
recognized as valid when they do return. But, if they leave
the State to evade the law, not intending at the time to
return and do gain a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</span></i> residence in another State
and, after that, do return, the marriage will be recognized.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>In other words, to furnish a State grounds to declare void
a marriage celebrated in another State where it is valid,
the parties must intend not only to evade the law but also
not to gain a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</span></i> residence in the State to which
they go.</p>

<p class='c007'>Efforts have been made to prohibit intermarriage in the
District of Columbia. At the last session of the Sixtieth
Congress, Senator Milton, of Florida, introduced
a bill to make intermarriage between white persons and
Negroes a crime punishable by imprisonment for ten years
and a fine of one thousand dollars, providing that one
with one-eighth or more Negro blood should come within
the prohibition, declaring such marriages to be null and
void and the issue resulting from them illegitimate and so
incapable of inheritance. This bill apparently died in
the committee room. A resolution in the Senate to recall
it from the Committee on the Judiciary was tabled on
March 1, 1909, by a vote of 43 to 21.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>INTERMARRIAGE AND THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION</h3>

<p class='c012'>The constitutionality of State statutes and judicial decisions
which have refused to recognize marriages between
Negroes and white persons celebrated in other States or in
the District of Columbia have been attacked on two grounds:
First, that they are in violation of article one, section ten,
of the Constitution of the United States, which says, in
part, that no State shall pass any law impairing the obligation
of contracts; and, secondly, that they contravene
that part of the Fourteenth Amendment which says that
no State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United
States.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marriage is declared by the statutes of the States which
prohibit intermarriage, just as by other States, to be a
civil contract. If it is a contract and if marriage between
a white person and a Negro in Massachusetts, for instance,
is valid, when the parties go to South Carolina to live, how
can the South Carolina courts declare the marriage a nullity
and prosecute the parties for fornication and adultery
without contravening the Federal Constitution? The only
answer is: Marriage is a civil contract, but it is something
more. Almost without exception, the courts have held that
a State has the absolute control of the marriage status
within its borders. The early case of State v. Gibson,<a id='r209' /><a href='#f209' class='c014'><sup>[209]</sup></a>
coming in 1871 during Reconstruction, sounded a warning
to the Federal Government’s interfering with the laws of
marriage. The court said: “In this State [Indiana] marriage
is treated as a civil contract, but it is more than a
mere civil contract. It is a public institution established
by God himself, is recognized in all Christian and civilized
nations, and is essential to the peace, happiness, and
well-being of society. In fact, society could not exist without
the institution of marriage, for upon it all the social
and domestic relations are based. The right of all the
States to regulate and control, to guard, protect, and
preserve this God-given, civilizing, and Christianizing institution
is of inestimable importance, and cannot be surrendered,
nor can the States suffer or permit any interference
therewith. If the Federal Government can determine
who may marry in a State, there is no limit to
its power....”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>The Supreme Court of Alabama<a id='r210' /><a href='#f210' class='c014'><sup>[210]</sup></a> in 1872 declared
that the laws against intermarriage did contravene the
Civil Rights Bill and the Fourteenth Amendment. But
this case was expressly overruled by Green v. State,<a id='r211' /><a href='#f211' class='c014'><sup>[211]</sup></a> in
which the court, answering both of the objections, said,
“Marriage is not a mere contract, but a social and domestic
institution upon which are founded all society and
order, to be regulated and controlled by the sovereign
power for the good of the State; and the several States of
the Union in the adoption of the recent Amendments to
the Constitution of the United States designed to secure
to citizens rights of a civil or political nature only, and
did not part with their hitherto unquestioned power of
regulating, within their own borders, matters of purely
social and domestic concern.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There are Federal cases to support the position of the
State Courts. But it is of no use to pile up citations of
decisions further to establish the well-accepted doctrine
that marriage is more than a civil contract, that it is a domestic
institution, and that a State, by virtue of its police
power, has absolute control as to who may contract marriages
or live in that relation within its borders.<a id='r212' /><a href='#f212' class='c014'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>Twenty-six States and Territories prohibit intermarriage
between the white and other races. They recognize
as valid such marriages when contracted in a State which
allows them, unless the parties are trying to evade the laws
of the State of their domicile or of their intended matrimonial
residence. The States prescribe a heavier penalty
for illicit intercourse between white persons and persons
of another race than for the same offence between two persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>of the same race; they inflict heavy punishments upon
ministers and other officials who perform a marriage ceremony
between a white person and one of another race,
and upon those who issue licenses for such a marriage;
and they declare the offspring of such marriages illegitimate
and incapable of inheritance. In each of these positions,
the courts, Federal as well as State, have upheld the
twenty-six States and Territories.</p>

<p class='c007'>Twenty-four States and Territories do not prohibit intermarriage
between the white and other races. It is not
within the province of this study to consider the actual
amount of admixture that is going on in these States.
But inasmuch as Boston has often been cited as the city
in which the number of marriages between white persons
and Negroes is very large (estimated by Senator Money,
of Mississippi, at 2,000 in 1902), the report of the registry
department of Boston for the years 1900–1907 is here
added:</p>

<p class='c007'>From this it appears that the number, never appreciably
large, has been steadily decreasing.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>The following is what Mr. Ray Stannard Baker<a id='r213' /><a href='#f213' class='c014'><sup>[213]</sup></a> has
to say about the precise fact of intermarriages in the
Northern States in general: “In the great majority of intermarriages
the white women belong to the lower walks
of life. They are German, Irish, or other foreign women,
respectable but ignorant. As far as I can see from investigating
a number of such cases, the home life is as
happy as that of other people in the same stratum of life.
But the white woman who marries a Negro is speedily
declassed: she is ostracised by the white people, and while
she finds a certain place among the Negroes, she is not
even readily accepted as a Negro. In short, she is cut
off from both races. When I was at Xenia, O., I was told
of a case of a white man who was arrested for living with
a Negro woman. The magistrate compelled him to marry
the Negro woman as the worst punishment he could invent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For this reason, although there are no laws in most
Northern States against mixed marriages, and although the
Negro population has been increasing, the number of intermarriages
is not only not increasing, but in many cities,
as in Boston, it is decreasing. It is an unpopular institution.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>CIVIL RIGHTS OF NEGROES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Thirteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution,
prohibiting slavery or involuntary servitude, except
as a punishment for crime, was proposed to the legislatures
of the thirty-six States on February 1, 1865, a little over
two months before the surrender of Lee at Appomattox, and
was declared to have been ratified by twenty-seven States,
the requisite three-fourths, by December 18, 1865. The
latter date marked the Negro’s final freedom from physical
bondage. His body could no longer be owned as chattel
property. But there is a vast difference between being able
to say “No man owns my body,” and “I have the same
rights, privileges, and immunities as other free men.”
This difference the Thirty-ninth Congress—that of 1865–1866—fully
realized, and grappled with.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first ten Amendments were passed soon after the
adoption of the Constitution to satisfy the demands of
those who were jealous of the power of the Federal government.
These, in brief, guaranteed to the citizens of the
United States (1) freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly,
and of petition for redress of grievances; (2) the
right to keep and bear arms; (3) the right not to have
soldiers quartered in one’s house in time of peace without
one’s consent; (4) freedom from unreasonable searches and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>seizures; (5) the right not to be denied life, liberty, or
property without due process of law; (6) the right to
trial by jury; (7) the right of the accused to be confronted
by his accuser; (8) the right not to have one’s
property taken for public use without compensation; and
(9) the right not to be subjected to cruel or unusual punishment,
and not to have excessive bail required. These
were limitations upon the power of Congress, the States
themselves having guaranteed such rights to their own
citizens by their bill of rights. After the War, the Federal
government was fearful that the States, particularly
those lately in rebellion, would not grant these rights or
privileges to the freedmen, who, according to the Dred
Scott decision, were not citizens. All the power that Congress
had over the States, it seems, was to enforce the
Thirteenth Amendment by appropriation legislation. But
it proceeded to make the most of the power it had, biding
its time when another amendment to the Constitution
would give it more power over the States.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS LEGISLATION</h3>

<p class='c012'>The first step taken by Congress, under the power supposedly
arising out of the Thirteenth Amendment, was an
attempt to secure to the Negro his so-called “civil rights.”
Unfortunately, there seems to be no succinct definition of
this term. Bouvier<a id='r214' /><a href='#f214' class='c014'><sup>[214]</sup></a> defines the phrase thus: “A term
applied to certain rights secured to citizens of the United
States by the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to
the Constitution and by various acts of Congress made in
pursuance thereof.” This definition, however, helps little,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>and one is thrown back upon the Amendments and subsidiary
enactments themselves to work out from them what
are the civil rights of a citizen and of the Negro in particular.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the summer and fall of 1865, between the close
of the War and the convening of Congress, there had developed
on the part of the radical element of the Republican
party under Thaddeus Stevens an opposition to President
Johnson’s Reconstruction plans. The first Civil
Rights Bill passed the Senate on February 2, 1866, passed
the House a few days later, but on March 27, was returned
with the veto of the President. It was passed, however,
over his veto on April 9, 1866, and was thereafter known
as the Civil Rights Bill<a id='r215' /><a href='#f215' class='c014'><sup>[215]</sup></a> of 1866. The first section reads:
“All persons born in the United States and not subject to
any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby
declared to be citizens of the United States; and such
citizens, of every race and color, without regard to any
previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude, except
as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have
been duly convicted, shall have the same right, in every
State and Territory in the United States, to make and
enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, and give evidence,
to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and
personal property, and to full and equal benefits of all laws
and proceedings for the security of person and property,
as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to
like punishments, pains, and penalties, and to none other,
any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom to the
contrary notwithstanding.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is evident that the first phrase was intended to contravene
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>the Dred Scott decision and to establish the Negro’s
citizenship. While the Bill was before Congress, the
great subject of debate was as to just what rights would
be given thereby to the Negro. Some opposed it because
they thought it would give him the right of suffrage, the
right to intermarry with whites, to attend the same schools
and churches, to sit on juries, and to testify in courts.
It must be remembered that the “Black Laws” of the
free States were still in force, and the Congressmen from
those States were as jealous of Federal interference on the
subject as those from the Southern States.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not the purpose here to discuss the Civil Rights
Bill as it was regarded by the people, but rather as it was
interpreted by the courts. Although it stood scarcely more
than two years before it was eclipsed and practically superseded
by the Fourteenth Amendment, nevertheless it stood
long enough to be tested by the courts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Negroes, prompted in some instances probably by
white persons, undertook immediately to see what rights
were really secured to them by the Bill. In Tennessee and
Mississippi, in 1866, convictions were had under the existing
State laws against intermarriage, as there had previously
been. Appeal to the Federal Supreme Court was
talked of, but nothing came of it. With a view to testing
their rights, Negroes in New York demanded sleeper accommodations
on railroads, and went to fashionable restaurants
and demanded the right to sit with the white
patrons, but in both instances were refused. In Baltimore
they sought accommodations on street cars, in theatres,
saloons, etc. with whites, but were met with the same refusal.<a id='r216' /><a href='#f216' class='c014'><sup>[216]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>The constitutionality of the Bill was denied in 1867 by
the Court of Appeals of Kentucky,<a id='r217' /><a href='#f217' class='c014'><sup>[217]</sup></a> on the ground that it
invaded the right of the State to regulate its own domestic
concerns. But its constitutionality was upheld in two
cases: United States v. Rhodes,<a id='r218' /><a href='#f218' class='c014'><sup>[218]</sup></a> 1866, in the Circuit Court,
a case involving the right of a Negro to testify, and <em>In re</em>
Turner,<a id='r219' /><a href='#f219' class='c014'><sup>[219]</sup></a> in the Circuit Court also, a Maryland case involving
the laws of apprenticeship.</p>

<p class='c007'>It appears that none of the cases involving the rights
of Negroes in public places, which are being considered particularly
in this chapter, reached the higher courts. But
Mr. Flack<a id='r220' /><a href='#f220' class='c014'><sup>[220]</sup></a> says: “The instances we have cited, however,
are apparently sufficient to justify the conclusion that the
belief prevailed generally—north, east, west and south—especially
among the Negroes, that the Civil Rights Bill
gave the colored people the same rights and privileges as
white men as regards travel, schools, theatres, churches,
and the ordinary rights which may be legally demanded.
There also seems to have been a less general belief that it
also permitted the intermarriage of the races.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As interesting as it would be to trace this Bill and the
subsequent Federal enactments through Congress, it would
take one too far afield. He must accept the products as
they came from the crucible of debate, and interpret their
effect upon the rights of Negroes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Civil Rights Bill of 1866 was practically superseded
by the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment,
ratified by thirty-six States and declared operative July 28,
1868. This section reads as follows: “All persons born
or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the
jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or
enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities
of citizens of the United States; nor shall any
State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without
due process of law, or deny to any person within its
jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Flack<a id='r221' /><a href='#f221' class='c014'><sup>[221]</sup></a> says that the purpose in the adoption of this
Amendment was (1) to make the Bill of Rights (the first
eight Amendments) binding upon the States as well as
upon the Nation; (2) to give validity to the Civil Rights
Bill of 1866; and (3) to declare who were citizens of the
United States. As he shows by an analysis of the debates
in Congress, the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Bill
of 1866 was doubted by many of its able advocates, and it
was natural that they should desire to make their tenets
secure by incorporating them into the Constitution itself.
It is worth remarking that on May 1, 1870, the Civil Rights
Bill of 1866 was practically re-enacted.<a id='r222' /><a href='#f222' class='c014'><sup>[222]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The words “Negro,” “race,” or “color” do not appear
in the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment; but
a study of the speeches before the House and Senate would
show that the legislators had the Negro primarily in mind,
and so the court understood. In the Slaughter-House
Cases<a id='r223' /><a href='#f223' class='c014'><sup>[223]</sup></a> of 1872, cases not having to do with the Negro in
the slightest degree, Mr. Justice Miller gave an interpretation
of the Fourteenth Amendment which has stood as a
landmark. He said: “... on the most casual examination
of the language of these Amendments [Thirteenth, Fourteenth,
and Fifteenth], no one can fail to be impressed
with the one pervading purpose found in them all, laying
at the foundation of each, and without which none of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>would have been even suggested; we mean the freedom of
the slave race, the security and firm establishment of that
freedom, and the protection of the newly-made freeman
and citizen from the oppressions of those who had formerly
exercised unlimited dominion over him. It is true that
only the Fifteenth Amendment, in terms, mentions the
Negro by speaking of his color and his slavery. But it
is just as true that each of the other articles were addressed
to the grievances of that race, and designed to remedy
them as the Fifteenth. We do not say that no one else
but the Negro can share in their protection.... But
we do say&nbsp;... that in any fair and just construction of
any section or phrase of these Amendments, it is necessary
to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading
spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed
to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the
Constitution, until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished,
as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.”
Without further citation of authorities, it may be assumed
that the primary purpose of Congress in drafting the
Fourteenth Amendment was to secure and protect the
rights and privileges of Negroes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next Federal legislation on the subject was the
Civil Rights Bill<a id='r224' /><a href='#f224' class='c014'><sup>[224]</sup></a> of 1875, which declared that all persons
within the jurisdiction of the United States should be
entitled to the full and equal enjoyment of the accommodations,
advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, public
conveyances on land or water, theatres and other places
of public amusement, subject only to the conditions established
by law and applicable alike to citizens of every
race and color, regardless of any previous condition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>servitude. The penalty for the violation of this law was
the forfeiture of five hundred dollars to the person aggrieved
and a fine of not less than five hundred dollars nor
more than one thousand dollars or imprisonment not less
than three months nor more than one year. The District
and Circuit Courts of the United States were given exclusive
jurisdiction of offences against this statute. District
attorneys, marshals, and deputy marshals of the United
States, and commissioners appointed by the Federal courts
were authorized to proceed against those violating the provisions
of the act.</p>

<p class='c007'>The years between 1865 and 1875 had witnessed changes
in the attitude of Congress toward the civil rights of
Negroes. The Bill of 1866 was general in its terms, yet
Congress did not feel secure till the Fourteenth Amendment
had been passed to give validity, in a sense, to what
had already been done. Now in 1875 Congress passed a
bill which far surpassed in scope anything that had theretofore
been undertaken. It is surprising that the test case
of its constitutionality did not reach the court of last resort
before 1883. During the year of its passage, 1875,
doubt was thrown upon its validity by Judge Dick in
charging the grand jury of the Federal Circuit Court of
North Carolina,<a id='r225' /><a href='#f225' class='c014'><sup>[225]</sup></a> who said, in part: “Every man has a
natural and inherent right of selecting his own associates,
and this natural right cannot be properly regulated by
legislative action, but must always be under the control of
the individual taste or inclination.” The same year, Judge
Emmons, of the Circuit Court in Tennessee,<a id='r226' /><a href='#f226' class='c014'><sup>[226]</sup></a> ruled that
the Fourteenth Amendment applied to State and not individual
action, and that the Federal government could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>not require individual innkeepers, theatre managers, etc.,
to entertain Negroes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The constitutionality of the Civil Rights Bill of 1875,
however, was finally settled in 1883. That year five cases<a id='r227' /><a href='#f227' class='c014'><sup>[227]</sup></a>
reached the Supreme Court, all of which had to do with
the civil rights of Negroes. Two of them concerned the
rights of colored persons in inns and hotels; two, their
rights in theatres; and one, in railroad cars. Mr. Justice
Bradley, delivering the opinion of the court, took the
ground that the first and second sections of the Civil
Rights Bill were unconstitutional for these reasons: (1)
They are not authorized by the Thirteenth Amendment,
abolishing and prohibiting slavery, because the separation
of the races in public places is not a badge of servitude.
“It would be running the slavery argument into the
ground,” he said, “to make it apply to every act of discrimination
which a person may see fit to make as to the
guests he will entertain, or as to the people he will take
into his coach, or cab, or car, or admit to his concert or
theatre, or deal with in other matters of intercourse or
business.” (2) The Civil Rights Bill is not authorized by
the Fourteenth Amendment, because that refers to action
by the State, while the Bill refers to individual discrimination.
It is State action of a particular kind that is
prohibited. “Individual invasion of individual rights,”
he argued, “is not the subject matter of the amendment....
It nullifies and makes void all State legislation,
and State action of every kind, which impairs the privileges
and immunities of citizens of the United States.... It
does not invest Congress with power to legislate upon subjects
which are within the domain of State legislation; but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>to provide modes of relief against State legislation or
State action.... It does not authorize Congress to create
a code of municipal laws for the regulation of private
rights, but to provide modes of redress against the operation
of State laws, and the action of State officers, executive
or judicial, when these are subversive of the fundamental
rights specified in the Amendment&nbsp;... until some
State law has been passed, or some State action through
its officers or agents has been taken, adverse to the rights
of citizens sought to be protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment, no legislation of the United States under
said Amendment, nor any proceeding under such legislation,
can be called into activity; for the prohibitions of
the Amendment are against State laws and acts done under
State authority.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The effect of this decision is that the Federal government
cannot prevent the curtailment of the civil rights
of Negroes by individuals unless such individuals are acting
under sanction of State statutes, and in that case, the Federal
court can only declare that the State statute is unconstitutional.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>STATE LEGISLATION BETWEEN 1865 AND 1883</h3>

<p class='c012'>The Civil Rights Bill of 1875 was the last effort of
Congress to guarantee to Negroes their civil rights. It
is well now to turn back in point of time, and trace the
action of the State legislatures on the subject. It has been
deemed advisable to let the year 1883 be the dividing point
in the history of the latter legislation. Before that time
the States were moving in conjunction with the Nation;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>after, the impotence of the Nation having been declared
by its Supreme Court, the burden of defining and securing
civil rights to Negroes devolved upon the States.
Moreover, it is well to treat the Southern States and the
States outside the South separately, because of the abnormal
conditions in the former occasioned by Reconstruction.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>In States Outside of South</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>Between 1865 and 1883 there was comparatively little
legislation in the Northern, Eastern, and Western States
as to civil rights. This was naturally so because these
States were waiting to see what the Federal government
meant to do. A brief examination of what little legislation
there was will be made.</p>

<p class='c007'>On May 16, 1865, Massachusetts<a id='r228' /><a href='#f228' class='c014'><sup>[228]</sup></a> declared that there
should be no distinction, discrimination, or restriction on
account of color or race in any licensed inn, public place
of amusement, public conveyance, or public meeting, and
imposed a fine of fifty dollars for the violation of this law.
The next year it included theatres<a id='r229' /><a href='#f229' class='c014'><sup>[229]</sup></a> within the prohibition,
but weakened the force of the statute by saying that there
should be no exclusion or restriction “except for good
cause.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The attitude of Delaware<a id='r230' /><a href='#f230' class='c014'><sup>[230]</sup></a> toward civil rights is probably
the most interesting of any of the Northern States.
On April 11, 1873, its legislature passed the following
“joint resolution in opposition to making Negroes the
equals of white men, politically or socially”:</p>

<p class='c007'>“That the members of this General Assembly, for the
people they represent, and for themselves, jointly and individually,
do hereby declare uncompromising opposition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>to a proposed act of Congress, introduced by Hon. Charles
Sumner at the last session, and now on file in the Senate
of the United States, known as the ‘Supplemental Civil
Rights Bill,’ and all other measures intended or calculated
to equalize or amalgamate the Negro race with the white
race, politically or socially, and especially do they proclaim
unceasing opposition to making Negroes eligible to public
offices, to sit on juries, and to their admission into public
schools where white children attend, and to the admission
on terms of equality with white people in the churches,
public conveyances, places of amusement, or hotels, and to
any measure designed or having the effect to promote the
equality of the Negro with the white man in any of the
relations of life, or which may possibly conduce to such
result.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That our Senators in Congress be instructed, and
our Representatives requested to vote against and use all
honorable means to defeat the passage by Congress of the
bill referred to in the foregoing resolution, known as the
‘Supplemental Civil Rights Bill,’ and all other measures
of a kindred nature, and any and every attempt to make
the Negro the peer of the white man.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the heels of this resolution, in 1875, Delaware<a id='r231' /><a href='#f231' class='c014'><sup>[231]</sup></a>
enacted a statute on March 15, 1875, which provided that
no keeper of an inn, tavern, hotel, or restaurant, or other
place of public entertainment or refreshment of travelers,
guests, or customers, should be obliged by law to furnish
entertainment or refreshment to persons whose reception
or entertainment by him would be offensive to the major
part of his customers, or would injure his business. The
term “customers” was taken to include all who sought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>entertainment or refreshment. The proprietor of a theatre
or other public place of amusement was not obliged to
receive into his show, or admit into the place where he was
pursuing his occupation, any person whose presence there
would be offensive to the major part of his spectators or
patrons, and thereby injure his business. Any carrier of
passengers might make such arrangements in his business
as would, if necessary, assign a particular place in his cars,
carriages, or boats, to such of his customers as he might
choose to place there, and whose presence elsewhere would
be offensive to the major part of the traveling public,
where his business was conducted; but the accommodations
must be equal if the same price for carriage was required
of all. This is still the law in Delaware. Taken in connection
with the joint resolution above, there is little doubt
that the legislature intended to make possible the drawing
of a color line, though it did not expressly say so. It is
noteworthy that, during the stormy years of Reconstruction,
some case testing its constitutionality did not arise.
Only one other State has had a statute anything like the
Delaware law, and that is Tennessee, which statute and,
with it, apparently the only case involving the constitutionality
of the law that has reached the courts will be discussed
later.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Kansas<a id='r232' /><a href='#f232' class='c014'><sup>[232]</sup></a> statute of April 25, 1874, which is still law,
provided that there should be no distinction on account of
race, color, or previous condition of servitude in any State
university, college, or other school of public instruction,
or in any licensed inn, hotel, boarding house, or any place
of public entertainment or amusement, or any steamboat,
railroad, stage coach, omnibus, street car, or any other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>means of public carriage for persons or freight, under penalty
of a fine of from ten to one thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='c007'>New York,<a id='r233' /><a href='#f233' class='c014'><sup>[233]</sup></a> on April 9, 1874, passed a Civil Rights
Bill which prohibited race distinctions in inns, public conveyances
on land and water, theatres, other public places
of amusements, common schools, public institutions of
learning, and cemeteries. It further declared that the discrimination
against a citizen on account of color, by the
use of the word “white,” or any other term, in any law,
statute, ordinance, or regulation, should be repealed. In
1881, it specifically mentioned hotels, inns, taverns, restaurants,
public conveyances, theatres, and other places of
public resort or amusement.<a id='r234' /><a href='#f234' class='c014'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>In South</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>One would naturally expect that most of the legislation
in the South guaranteeing civil rights to Negroes would
have come during the period that their governments were
in the hands of the Reconstructionists, and such is the case.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1866 a Florida<a id='r235' /><a href='#f235' class='c014'><sup>[235]</sup></a> statute made it a misdemeanor for
a person of color to intrude himself into any religious or
other public assembly of white persons, or into a railroad
car or other public vehicle set apart for the exclusive accommodation
of white people, or for a white person so
to intrude upon the accommodations of colored persons.
By 1873, however, the political revolution had come, and a
statute<a id='r236' /><a href='#f236' class='c014'><sup>[236]</sup></a> of that year forbade discrimination on account of
race, color, or previous condition of servitude, in the full
and equal enjoyment of the accommodations, etc., of inns,
public conveyances on land and water, licensed theatres,
other places of public amusement, common schools, public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>institutions of learning, cemeteries, and benevolent associations
supported by general taxation. This prohibition did
not apply to private schools or cemeteries established exclusively
for white or colored persons. It added, as did
the law of New York, that there should be no discrimination
in any laws by using the word “white.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A statute of Louisiana<a id='r237' /><a href='#f237' class='c014'><sup>[237]</sup></a> in 1869 prohibited any discrimination
on account of race or color by common carriers,
innkeepers, hotel keepers, or keepers of public resorts.
The license of such places had to contain the stipulation
that they must be open to all without distinction or discrimination
on account of color. The penalty was forfeiture
of the license and a suit for damages by the party
aggrieved. This statute<a id='r238' /><a href='#f238' class='c014'><sup>[238]</sup></a> was strengthened in 1873 by
the further provision that all persons, without regard to
race or color, must have “equal and impartial accommodations”
on public conveyances, in inns and other places of
public resort. It was the duty of the attorney-general to
bring suit in the name of the State to take away the license
of anyone violating the law. The statute imposed a fine
upon common carriers running from other States into Louisiana
who made any discrimination against citizens of the
latter on account of race or color.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arkansas,<a id='r239' /><a href='#f239' class='c014'><sup>[239]</sup></a> in 1873, required the same accommodations
to be furnished to all by common carriers, keepers of public
houses of entertainment, inns, hotels, restaurants,
saloons, groceries, dramshops, or other places where liquor
was sold, public schools, and benevolent institutions supported
in whole or partly by general taxation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The law of Tennessee<a id='r240' /><a href='#f240' class='c014'><sup>[240]</sup></a> of 1875 is in a very different
tone, it being very much like, as has been said before, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>of Delaware. That statute reads: “The rule of the common
law giving a right of action to any person excluded
from any hotel, or public means of transportation, or place
of amusement, is hereby abrogated; and hereafter no keeper
of any hotel, or public house, or carrier of passengers for
hire, or conductors, drivers, or employees of such carrier
or keeper, shall be bound, or under any obligation to entertain,
carry, or admit any person, whom he shall for any
reason whatever, choose not to entertain, carry, or admit,
to his house, hotel, carriage, or means of transportation
or place of amusement; nor shall any right exist in favor
of any such person so refused admission, but the right of
such keepers of hotels and public houses, carriers of passengers,
and keepers of places of amusement and their
employees to control the access and admission or exclusion
of persons to or from their public houses, means of transportation,
and places of amusement, shall be as perfect and
complete as that of any person over his private house,
carriage, or private theatre, or place of amusement for
his family.” This Tennessee law is even more sweeping
than that of Delaware. In the latter, common carriers
may provide separate accommodations for persons that
would be disagreeable to the major portion of the traveling
public; in the former, the common carrier might exclude
such persons altogether. According to the Tennessee statute,
every railroad company in the State had a right to
refuse absolutely to carry Negroes on its cars. Of course,
this has been changed by its “Jim Crow” laws. The case
of State v. Lasater,<a id='r241' /><a href='#f241' class='c014'><sup>[241]</sup></a> dealing with the second section of
the Tennessee statute, has the following to say about the
whole enactment: “This is an extraordinary statute. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>is generally understood to have been passed to avoid the
supposed effects of an act of Congress on the same subject,
known as the Civil Rights Bill.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The constitutionality of the Tennessee and Delaware
statutes has not been tested, as far as is known. Therefore,
in the absence of authority, an opinion on the matter
is of little value, but the following suggestion is ventured:
Originally, hotels and inns were no more public places
than a man’s dwelling, and one could choose his patrons
just as he could choose the guests he would entertain,
and might exclude anyone without giving his reasons for it,
as a merchant might refuse to sell goods to anyone he
chose. For historical reasons, which need not be discussed
here, the courts held that an inn-keeper should not be allowed
to refuse an applicant for entertainment unless he
had some valid reason for it. The common law thereafter
considered hotels, etc., public places. It has been seen
that the Civil Rights Cases held that the Federal government
cannot prohibit a hotel-keeper from refusing to receive
an applicant, but that the regulation of such domestic
relations is within the exclusive control of the State. If
the State sees fit to pass a statute abrogating the common
law, as Tennessee and Delaware did, and making hotels,
etc., private places, as they were originally, there seems
to be no valid constitutional objection. The reasoning
that applies to hotels will apply to other places now considered
public, possibly even to public conveyances.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following resolution of the legislature of North
Carolina<a id='r242' /><a href='#f242' class='c014'><sup>[242]</sup></a> of 1877 is worth quoting in full. It is especially
significant because it was passed after the Reconstruction
régime was over, and the State government had passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>back into hands of the Democratic party, with Zebulon B.
Vance as Governor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Whereas</em>, In the providence of God, the colored people
have been set free, and this is their country and their
home, as well as that of the white people, and there should
be nothing to prevent the two races from dwelling together
in the land in harmony and peace;</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Whereas</em>, We recognize the duty of the stronger race
to uphold the weaker, and that upon it rests the responsibility
of an honest and faithful endeavor to raise the weaker
race to the level of intelligent citizenship; and</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Whereas</em>, The colored people have been erroneously
taught that legislation under Democratic auspices would
be inimical to their rights and interests, thereby causing a
number of them to entertain honest fears in the premises,</p>

<p class='c007'>“The General Assembly of North Carolina do resolve,
That, while we regard with repugnance the absurd attempts,
by means of ‘Civil Rights’ Bills, to eradicate certain
race distinctions, implanted by nature and sustained
by the habits of forty centuries; and while we are sure that
good government demands for both races alike that the
great representation and executive offices of the country
should be administered by men of the highest intelligence
and best experience in public affairs, we do, nevertheless,
heartily accord alike to every citizen, without distinction
of race or color, equality before the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Resolved</em>, That we recognize the full purport and intent
of that amendment to the Constitution of the United
States which confers the right of suffrage and citizenship
upon the people of color, and that part of the Constitution
of North Carolina conferring educational privileges upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>both races: that we are disposed and determined to carry
out in good faith these as all other constitutional provisions.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>STATE LEGISLATION AFTER 1883</h3>
<h4 class='c011'><em>In South</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>The civil rights legislation in the South after 1883 may
be shortly disposed of, for an examination of the session
laws of the Southern States since that time reveals only
one statute that can at all properly be called a Civil Rights
Bill. That was a statute of Tennessee<a id='r243' /><a href='#f243' class='c014'><sup>[243]</sup></a> of March 25,
1885, providing against discrimination in theatres, shows,
parks, places of public resort for observation of scenery
or amusement of any kind whatever, where fee or toll is
charged. But it adds this significant section: “That nothing
herein contained shall be construed as interfering with
the existing rights to provide separate accommodations and
seats for colored and white persons at such places.” It
may be taken for granted that the Civil Rights Bills passed
in the South by the Reconstruction administrations became
inoperative, if they were not actually repealed, as soon as
the government reverted to the hands of the resident white
people. Of course, all the Southern legislation as to separate
schools and separate accommodations in public conveyances
relates to the civil rights of Negroes, and most
of this has come since 1883, but the discussion of these
two important subjects is postponed to later chapters.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>In States Outside of South</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>The Federal Civil Rights Bill, as has been seen, was
declared unconstitutional in 1883, and the national government
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>was thereby declared impotent to secure for Negroes
equality of accommodations in public places. Thus
the burden, as has been said before, was thrown upon the
States. Many of the States outside the South responded
by adopting bills which practically copied the Civil Rights
Bill of 1875. The following is a list of the States that
have such Civil Rights Bills with the dates of their adoption
and amendments: Connecticut,<a id='r244' /><a href='#f244' class='c014'><sup>[244]</sup></a> 1884 and 1905;
Iowa,<a id='r245' /><a href='#f245' class='c014'><sup>[245]</sup></a> 1884 and 1892; New Jersey,<a id='r246' /><a href='#f246' class='c014'><sup>[246]</sup></a> 1884; Ohio,<a id='r247' /><a href='#f247' class='c014'><sup>[247]</sup></a> 1884
and 1894; Colorado,<a id='r248' /><a href='#f248' class='c014'><sup>[248]</sup></a> 1885 and 1895; Illinois,<a id='r249' /><a href='#f249' class='c014'><sup>[249]</sup></a> 1885;
Indiana,<a id='r250' /><a href='#f250' class='c014'><sup>[250]</sup></a> 1885; Massachusetts,<a id='r251' /><a href='#f251' class='c014'><sup>[251]</sup></a> 1885, 1893, and 1895;
Michigan,<a id='r252' /><a href='#f252' class='c014'><sup>[252]</sup></a> 1885; Minnesota,<a id='r253' /><a href='#f253' class='c014'><sup>[253]</sup></a> 1885, 1897, and 1899; Nebraska,<a id='r254' /><a href='#f254' class='c014'><sup>[254]</sup></a>
1885 and 1893; Rhode Island,<a id='r255' /><a href='#f255' class='c014'><sup>[255]</sup></a> 1885; New
York,<a id='r256' /><a href='#f256' class='c014'><sup>[256]</sup></a> 1893 and 1895; Pennsylvania,<a id='r257' /><a href='#f257' class='c014'><sup>[257]</sup></a> 1887; Washington,<a id='r258' /><a href='#f258' class='c014'><sup>[258]</sup></a>
1890; Wisconsin,<a id='r259' /><a href='#f259' class='c014'><sup>[259]</sup></a> 1895; and California,<a id='r260' /><a href='#f260' class='c014'><sup>[260]</sup></a> 1897.
The Kansas<a id='r261' /><a href='#f261' class='c014'><sup>[261]</sup></a> bill has already been considered.</p>

<p class='c007'>A clearer idea of what the various State statutes mean
and how they differ from the Civil Rights Bill of 1875
may be got from the accompanying table. The list contains
the names of places where all citizens, without regard to
race, color, or previous condition of servitude are guaranteed
equality of accommodation. It will be noticed that
none of the Southern States have Civil Rights Bills and,
therefore, depend upon the courts to determine the rights
of citizens in public places, and in addition the following
States have no such statute: Delaware, Idaho, Maine,
Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire,
North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont,
West Virginia, and Wyoming.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>The wording of all the statutes is essentially the same.
Each provides that all citizens within the jurisdiction of
the State, without regard to race, color, or previous condition
of servitude, are entitled to the full and equal accommodations,
advantages, facilities, and privileges of the
various places mentioned. The offending party may be
either indicted and fined or imprisoned, or he may be
sued by the aggrieved party. In some States, an action
by the State is a bar to an action by the party and vice
versa. One who aids or abets in a discrimination against a
person on account of race, color, or previous condition of
servitude is punished to the same extent as the one actually
committing the act.</p>

<p class='c007'>Heretofore only legislative enactments, State and Federal,
as to the civil rights of Negroes have been considered.
It is well now to turn to the courts to see how the laws
have been interpreted as regards various public places.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>HOTELS</h3>

<p class='c012'>Only six States expressly forbid race distinctions in
hotels. But it may be assumed that the sixteen States
which mention inns mean to include hotels.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1876 a Negro minister applied for a room at a Philadelphia
hotel and was refused accommodation, though one
of the guests offered to share his room with him. At that
time there was no law in Pennsylvania requiring hotel-keepers
to receive colored persons; but the Federal court<a id='r262' /><a href='#f262' class='c014'><sup>[262]</sup></a>
held that the clerk might be liable under the Federal Civil
Rights Bill of 1875.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1898 one Russ applied for a license to open a hotel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>in Pennsylvania. In granting it, the court<a id='r263' /><a href='#f263' class='c014'><sup>[263]</sup></a> took the occasion
to express its view on race distinctions in the following
words: “A sober, respectable, and well-behaved colored
man or woman is entitled under the law of Pennsylvania
to be received in any house of entertainment and be treated
in the same manner as any other guest. It is time that
race discrimination ceased in this State.... No one objects
any longer to his [the Negro’s] presence in a public
conveyance or place of entertainment; thus far the prejudice
of race has been overcome; it is quite certain that
the objection to his presence in a hotel or restaurant will
also pass away as soon as his right under the law to be
there is recognized in fact as it now is by the letter of the
statute.... It would be vain to deny that some race
prejudice still exists among us, but the law does not countenance
it, and good citizens should strive to rise above it.
We trust the effort will be made and that toleration and
moderation will mark the conduct of both races.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1896 the members of the Indiana University football
team went to the Nutt House in Crawfordsville, Indiana,
for accommodation. One of the members of the team was
a Negro. The clerk refused to take the Negro in with the
rest of the guests, but offered to let him eat at the “ordinary.”
The Negro, being a minor, brought suit through
his next friend, and the Indiana<a id='r264' /><a href='#f264' class='c014'><sup>[264]</sup></a> court held that the Civil
Rights Bill of the State could not be satisfied by separate
accommodations.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no case of race discrimination in the hotels of
Massachusetts that has reached the higher courts, but in
April, 1896, the following resolution<a id='r265' /><a href='#f265' class='c014'><sup>[265]</sup></a> was passed by the
General Court of the State:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“<em>Whereas</em>, On the twenty-ninth day of January, eighteen
ninety-six, the Reverend Benjamin W. Arnett, D.D.,
of Wilberforce, Ohio, senior bishop of the African Methodist
Episcopal Church, president of the board of trustees
of Wilberforce University, and member of many learned
societies, was refused entertainment at certain reputable
hotels in the city of Boston, because he was a colored man,
in spite of the statute laws against discrimination on account
of color; therefore,</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Resolved</em>, That the senate and house of representatives
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in general
court assembled, successors of those bodies which repeatedly
elected Charles Sumner to the Senate of the United States,
and for four years received messages from John A. Andrew,
hereby express their severest reprobation of such
discrimination and their firm conviction of the truth of the
clause of the Declaration of Independence wherein all men
are declared to be created equal; and it is further</p>

<p class='c007'>“<em>Resolved</em>, That still more to be reprobated is the sentiment
of any part of the public against any class of our
fellow citizens whereby such discrimination is rendered
possible, and that a vigorous campaign for statute rights
by the persons most aggrieved will meet the hearty approval
and coöperation of the two branches of the General
Court.” This is very significant as showing the actual
attitude of the hotels of Boston toward receiving Negroes.
Whether the “vigorous campaign” was conducted one cannot
tell; certainly no case appears to have reached the
courts. And there is in Boston at present a Negro hotel.</p>

<p class='c007'>The manager of the Lucerne Hotel in New York City
in 1905, refused to lease a suite to a woman because she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>was a Jewess. It was a family hotel, containing small
suites like those found in an ordinary apartment house,
rented upon annual leases, transients not being solicited.
The New York court<a id='r266' /><a href='#f266' class='c014'><sup>[266]</sup></a> held that it was not a hotel in the
sense that the manager must receive all applicants without
regard to race or color. Of course, this case did not
concern the Negro, but the same principle is involved.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>RESTAURANTS</h3>

<p class='c012'>Race discrimination in restaurants is prohibited by thirteen
States; in taverns, by one; in eating-houses, by eleven;
in boarding-houses, by one; in cafés, by one; in chop-houses,
by one; and at lunch-counters, by one. These will
be considered under the general head of restaurants.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1881 a Negro was refused accommodation in a restaurant
in New York. At that time the laws of the State
prohibited discrimination in inns. The restaurant-keeper
argued as a defence in the suit that followed that the restaurant
was not included in the term “inns.” The court<a id='r267' /><a href='#f267' class='c014'><sup>[267]</sup></a>
held that the legislature meant by “inn” a place that furnished
both lodging and food to guests, that “restaurant”
had no fixed legal meaning, and that the declaration was
sufficient if it said “inn” and then explained it by calling
it a restaurant.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Negro went to a restaurant in Detroit in 1887 and
asked for accommodation. The clerk told him that he
could not be served on the restaurant side, but that he
would be served if he went over on the saloon side. The
colored man complained to the proprietor and was told
that it was the rule of the house not to serve Negroes in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>the restaurant room. The statute of Michigan required
full and equal accommodation in restaurants. The court<a id='r268' /><a href='#f268' class='c014'><sup>[268]</sup></a>
held that the statute would not be satisfied if the Negro
were given as good accommodations but in a different
room, saying: “In Michigan there must be and is an absolute,
unconditional equality of white and colored men
before the law.... Whatever right a white man has in a
public place, the black man has also.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1897 a colored man went into a restaurant in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin. After sitting at the table forty minutes
without having his order taken, he complained, and
was told that he was not served because he was colored.
He left, and later brought suit. At the trial, it appeared
that the discrimination was not with the sanction of the
proprietor, that he had told the waiter to serve Negroes,
that the waiter had refused to do so and was discharged
therefor. Nevertheless, the court<a id='r269' /><a href='#f269' class='c014'><sup>[269]</sup></a> held that the proprietor
was liable for the act of his servant, and gave compensatory
damages to the Negro.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next year, a restaurant keeper refused to accommodate
a Negro in Lucas County, Ohio, and the court<a id='r270' /><a href='#f270' class='c014'><sup>[270]</sup></a>
allowed the Negro to recover the penalty prescribed by the
law. The case was decided on a question of evidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1905 a Negro was serving on the jury in a civil case
in Iowa. The bailiff had arranged with a boarding-house
to serve meals. When the Negro, along with the other
jurors, went for his meals, the boarding-house keeper refused
to allow him to sit at the same table with the others.
It was not questioned that this was in violation of the
Civil Rights Bill of the State if the boarding-house was
an “eating-house” within the terms of the statute. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>court<a id='r271' /><a href='#f271' class='c014'><sup>[271]</sup></a> charged the jury that such an eating-house as
would come within the statute must be a place where meals
are served to anyone applying at the same prices charged
to all, but that, if meals are served only in pursuance of a
previous arrangement for particular individuals, rather
than anyone who may apply, it is a private boarding-house
and not within the statute.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>BARBER-SHOPS</h3>

<p class='c012'>Thirteen States provide that barbers must serve all
persons without regard to race or color.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1889 a barber in Lincoln, Nebraska, refused to shave
a Negro because he was “colored.” The Civil Rights Bill
of that State mentions barbers. The court<a id='r272' /><a href='#f272' class='c014'><sup>[272]</sup></a> held: “A
barber, by opening a shop and putting out his sign, thereby
invites every orderly and well-behaved person who may desire
his services to enter his shop during business hours.
The statute will not permit him to say to one, you were
a slave or the son of a slave, therefore I will not shave
you. Such prejudices are unworthy of our better manhood,
and are clearly prohibited by the statute.” Barber-shops
were included within the provisions of the Massachusetts
Civil Rights Bill in 1893, but, as a matter of fact, Negroes
are not even now given the same accommodations as whites
in barber-shops in Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The statute of Connecticut requires equality of service
in “places of public accommodation.” A barber refused
to serve one Faulkner because he was a Negro, and the latter
brought suit on the ground that a barber-shop is a place
of public accommodation and, hence, within the Civil
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>Rights Bill of the State. The court<a id='r273' /><a href='#f273' class='c014'><sup>[273]</sup></a> held that the barber-shop
is not, in its nature, different from the places of
business run for private gain, and that the common law
has never recognized it as possessing the quality of a place
of public accommodation, as a hotel, public conveyance,
etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may be added here that most of the cases have involved
the point as to what are places of public accommodation
or amusement or resort. If the place is mentioned
in the Civil Rights Bill, it is, of course, within the prohibition,
and it is a violation of the statute even to require
separate accommodations, although equal in every other
respect. But a vast deal of litigation has arisen out of
instances of Negroes being denied accommodation in places
considered public in their nature but which are not mentioned
in the Civil Rights Bill of the State wherein the case
arises.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>BOOTBLACK STANDS</h3>

<p class='c012'>In the year 1901, Basso, a bootblack in the basement of
one of the business houses of Rochester, New York, refused
to serve Burks because the latter was a Negro. The law
of New York, as has been seen, requires full and equal
accommodations in hotels and “other places of public accommodation.”
The question, therefore, was: Is a bootblack
stand a place of “public accommodation”? The municipal
court of Rochester, in which Burks brought suit,
gave judgment for him, thereby answering the question
in the affirmative. The county court reversed the decision.
The appellate division reversed the county court and sustained
the municipal. The court of appeals<a id='r274' /><a href='#f274' class='c014'><sup>[274]</sup></a> reversed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>appellate division thereby sustaining the county court, saying:
“A bootblacking stand may be said to be a place
of public accommodation, like the store of a dry goods merchant,
a grocer, or the proverbial ‘butcher, baker, and
candlestick maker’; but that is very far from placing it
in the same category with the places specifically named in
the statute. Inns, hotels, and public conveyances are places
of public accommodation in the broadest sense, because
they have always been denominated as such under the common
law. Bath-houses and barber-shops are not to be regarded
as included within the statute under the general
phrase, ‘and all other places of public accommodation.’
There is no more relation between a bootblacking stand and
a public conveyance than there is between a theatre or
music-hall and a bath-house or barber-shop. There is, it
is true, a superficial resemblance between the occupation of
the barber and that of the bootblack, in the sense that both
minister to the personal comfort and convenience of others;
but the same argument could be extended far beyond the
limits necessary to demonstrate that not ‘all other places
of public accommodation’ are included by relation within
the category of the things specifically enumerated in the
statute.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>BILLIARD-ROOMS</h3>

<p class='c012'>In Massachusetts in 1866, a certain Negro was refused,
because of his race or color, the use of a billiard-room. At
that time a statute of the Commonwealth required equal
accommodation in public places of amusement. The Supreme
Court<a id='r275' /><a href='#f275' class='c014'><sup>[275]</sup></a> of Massachusetts, in which the Negro’s case
was finally heard, held that there was no proof that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>room was licensed, and added: “It cannot be supposed that
it was the intent of the legislature to prescribe the manner
in which persons should use their own premises or permit
others to use them, if they did not carry on therein an
occupation or business, or suffer other persons to appropriate
them to a purpose, which required a license in order to
render such an appropriation lawful.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SALOONS</h3>

<p class='c012'>Only two States, Minnesota and Wisconsin, mention
saloons in their Civil Rights Bills. And in Minnesota, they
were not added till 1899, as a result of the following case:
A Negro was denied accommodation in a saloon. At that
time, the statute required equal accommodations in inns
and “places of public resort, refreshment, accommodation,
or entertainment.” The court<a id='r276' /><a href='#f276' class='c014'><sup>[276]</sup></a> of that State, in
passing on the case, held that a saloon is not among the
other “places of public refreshment.” The court suggests
that “or other” means “other such like” and includes
only places of the same nature as those already mentioned
specifically in the statute. About the Negro, the court
said: “It is a well-known fact that, owing to an unreasonable
race prejudice which still exists to some extent,
the promiscuous entertainment of persons of different
races in places where intoxicating drinks are sold not infrequently
result in personal conflicts, especially when the
passions of men are inflamed by liquor. Hence the legislature
might have omitted saloons for that reason.” The
next year the legislature answered otherwise by adding
saloons to the Civil Rights Bill.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>In 1899 a bar-keeper in Ohio charged a Negro thirty
cents for a cocktail, the regular price to white customers
being only fifteen cents. The Civil Rights Bill of Ohio
did not mention saloons, but said “other places of public
accommodation and amusement.” The court<a id='r277' /><a href='#f277' class='c014'><sup>[277]</sup></a> held that
saloons were not included, adding, in the same spirit as
the Minnesota court “... nor should we interpret this
statute as encouraging a tariff which the clearly defined
policy of the State discourages.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A statute of Louisiana<a id='r278' /><a href='#f278' class='c014'><sup>[278]</sup></a> of 1908 requires separate saloons
for white and colored persons. The Louisiana court,<a id='r279' /><a href='#f279' class='c014'><sup>[279]</sup></a>
in July, 1909, held that the sale of liquor to white and
colored persons must not be conducted in the same building,
and that the statute is not obeyed by providing separate
bars in the same building. The saloon keeper had attempted
to avoid paying taxes on two saloons by operating
two bars in the same building.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Atlanta,<a id='r280' /><a href='#f280' class='c014'><sup>[280]</sup></a> before State prohibition began, there were
separate saloons for the white and colored people. An ordinance
of Nashville,<a id='r281' /><a href='#f281' class='c014'><sup>[281]</sup></a> Tennessee, which went into effect
July 7, 1907, required the segregation of the races in saloons.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SODA FOUNTAINS</h3>

<p class='c012'>The keeper of a soda fountain in Illinois in 1896 refused
to sell cold drinks to a Negro. At that time the
law required equal accommodation in inns and “all
other places of accommodation and amusement.” The
court<a id='r282' /><a href='#f282' class='c014'><sup>[282]</sup></a> of that State held that a soda fountain is not such
a place of accommodation or amusement. “Such a place,”
the court argued, “can be considered a place of accommodation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>or amusement to no greater extent than a places
where dry goods or clothing, boots and shoes, hats and
caps, or groceries, are dispensed. The personal liberty of
an individual in his business transactions, and his freedom
from restrictions, is a question of utmost moment, and
no construction can be adopted by which an individual
right of action will be included as controlled within a
legislative enactment, unless clearly expressed in such enactment
and certainly included within the constitutional
limitation on the power of the legislature.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>THEATRES</h3>

<p class='c012'>The question of the rights of Negroes in theatres has
given rise to a number of judicial decisions. Fifteen States
provide by statute that there shall be no race distinction
in theatres. In 1873, the laws of Mississippi, under the
Reconstruction government, declared that all persons, without
distinction as to race, color, or previous condition of
servitude, should have equal and impartial enjoyment of
theatres. One Donnell, held in custody for refusing to
pay a fine for violating this law by refusing to sell theatre
tickets to two Negroes, petitioned for a writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">habeas
corpus</span></i>. The court<a id='r283' /><a href='#f283' class='c014'><sup>[283]</sup></a> held that the law was not unconstitutional,
because it in no way appropriated private property
to public use.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two years later, in reply to a question whether it was
a crime to refuse a Negro equal accommodations in a hotel,
Judge Emmons in Tennessee charged the grand jury<a id='r284' /><a href='#f284' class='c014'><sup>[284]</sup></a> that
the Federal government had no right to require individual
innkeepers, theatre managers, etc., to entertain Negroes.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>In 1876 a Negro in Louisiana bought a ticket to a theatre,
which he was not allowed to use on account of his
color. He sued for five thousand dollars damages. The
Constitution of that State, at the time, guaranteed equal
accommodations in public places. The Louisiana court<a id='r285' /><a href='#f285' class='c014'><sup>[285]</sup></a>
held that this law “does not enumerate a mere abstraction,
but it guarantees substantial rights.” The Negro’s
claim was sustained, but the damages were reduced to three
hundred dollars and costs. Both this and the Mississippi
case arose in the South and were decided favorably to the
rights of the Negro, but both came during the Reconstruction
régime. Since then, no such case appears to have risen
in the South.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1889 a Negro woman in Illinois, having been refused
tickets to a theatre, had a white man buy them
for herself and her husband. On presenting the tickets
they were refused admission to seats in the theatre which
the tickets called for. At the resulting trial, the proprietor
offered to prove that he had, “in order to avoid collision
between the races, adopted a rule (and that such rule was
necessary) to the effect that the colored people should have
one row to themselves in each part of the house, or as many
rows as the tickets which they bought would call for.”
This evidence was rejected, the court<a id='r286' /><a href='#f286' class='c014'><sup>[286]</sup></a> holding that the
Civil Rights Bill of Illinois could not be satisfied by separate
accommodations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Missouri has no Civil Rights Bill. A Negro, mistaken
for a white man by the clerk in the box-office, bought tickets
for seats in the orchestra of a Kansas City theatre.
When he presented his tickets to the usher he was refused
the seats called for, but was offered in exchange balcony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>seats reserved for Negroes. The court<a id='r287' /><a href='#f287' class='c014'><sup>[287]</sup></a> before which the
case was tried held that the rule of the theatre requiring
separate accommodations for the races was not a violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most recent case<a id='r288' /><a href='#f288' class='c014'><sup>[288]</sup></a> appears to be a 1905 case in
New York in which a Negro was ejected from a theatre
by an employee. The proprietor was permitted to show
that the ejectment was done while he was away and contrary
to his orders, and that he permitted Negroes to enjoy
the privileges of the place. A verdict was thereupon found
for him, but the case was remanded by the appellate court
for a new trial, on the ground that the evidence was improperly
admitted.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SKATING RINKS</h3>

<p class='c012'>California, Illinois, and Massachusetts have considered
skating rinks of enough importance to include them in
their Civil Rights Bills. In 1885 the keeper of a skating
rink in Iowa refused to let a Negro use it, and the Negro
brought suit. The court<a id='r289' /><a href='#f289' class='c014'><sup>[289]</sup></a> held that the exclusion of a
colored man from a skating rink not licensed is not illegal.
The New York court<a id='r290' /><a href='#f290' class='c014'><sup>[290]</sup></a> has held that a skating rink is
a “place of public amusement” within the meaning of
the statute, so that a keeper of one cannot refuse admission
to a Negro.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>CEMETERIES</h3>

<p class='c012'>The early Civil Rights Bills of New York, Florida, and
Kansas prohibited race distinctions in public cemeteries.
This stipulation, however, does not appear in the present
statutes of any of the States, except Kansas. Race distinctions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>in cemeteries are common. The legislature of
Mississippi<a id='r291' /><a href='#f291' class='c014'><sup>[291]</sup></a> of 1900, for instance, gave the Ladies’ Auxiliary
Cemetery Association, an organization of white
women, permission to remove the monument and remains
of the Negro State Secretary of State, James Lynch, from
the white to the Negro cemetery in Jackson, Mississippi,
provided it was done without expense to the State.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Raleigh, N. C., <cite>News and Observer</cite> of February
20, 1906, quotes the Germantown, Pa., <cite>Guide</cite> as calling
on the people to provide a cemetery where Negroes may
be buried, saying that “unless something is done, the
bodies of the colored poor will be denied the right of decent
burial, for their disposal, of necessity, will be by means
of the dissecting rooms of anatomical boards.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Civil Rights Bills of the eighteen States have now
been analyzed, and the judicial decisions arising therefrom
have been considered. It is noticeable that, if one excepts
the theatre cases of the Reconstruction period, not a case
has come from a Southern State. The explanation must be
that those States have never undertaken to require hotel-keepers,
etc., to offer accommodations without regard to
color: the Negroes have taken for granted that they would
not be admitted to such places, except upon condition that
they would accept the accommodations set apart for their
race, and consequently have not applied for admission upon
any other terms. In the other States the courts have, as
a rule, interpreted the Civil Rights Bills very strictly. If
a place is not specifically mentioned in the statute, courts
have been very slow to include it under the general head
of “other places of amusement or accommodation.” In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>other words, this phrase, which is, in substance, tacked on
to every statute, is a dead letter. The courts are chary,
as they should be, of invading individual liberty and freedom
of business. But if a place is specifically mentioned
in the statute, the law is not satisfied by offering separate
accommodations to Negroes, even though such accommodations
are equal for both races in every respect; they must
be identical.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>RACE DISCRIMINATION BY INSURANCE COMPANIES</h3>

<p class='c012'>Some allied topics may be properly discussed under the
general head of civil rights.</p>

<p class='c007'>Five States—Connecticut,<a id='r292' /><a href='#f292' class='c014'><sup>[292]</sup></a> Massachusetts,<a id='r293' /><a href='#f293' class='c014'><sup>[293]</sup></a> Ohio,<a id='r294' /><a href='#f294' class='c014'><sup>[294]</sup></a>
New York,<a id='r295' /><a href='#f295' class='c014'><sup>[295]</sup></a> and Michigan,<a id='r296' /><a href='#f296' class='c014'><sup>[296]</sup></a>—have deemed it necessary
to pass laws prohibiting any discrimination on account of
race or color by life insurance companies. All of the statutes
are essentially the same. They declare that no life
insurance company shall make any distinction or discrimination
between white and colored persons wholly or partly
of African descent, as to premiums or rates charged for
policies; nor shall such company demand higher premiums
from colored persons than from whites of the same age,
sex, general condition of health, and hope of longevity;
nor shall it make or require any rebate, diminution, or discount
upon the sum to be paid on the policy in case of the
death of the colored person. Such a company is forbidden
to add any stipulation by which the insured binds himself,
his heirs, executors, assigns, etc., to accept any sum less
than the face value of the policy. Massachusetts provides
that if a company refuses to insure a colored person making
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>application, it must, upon his request, give him a certificate
of the regular examining physician, saying that the
refusal was not because the applicant is a person of color,
but solely upon the grounds of general health and prospect
of longevity as would be applicable to white persons of the
same age and sex.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Connecticut statute enacts that any condition or
stipulation in the policy, inserted because of the color or
race of the insured, shall be void. Ohio provides that any
corporation, or officer or agent of such corporation, violating
the provisions of its statute, shall be fined for each
offence not less than one hundred dollars nor more than
two hundred dollars, but that nothing in the act shall be
construed as to require any agent or company to take or
receive the application for insurance of any person. New
York makes the violation of the law a misdemeanor punishable
by a fine of from fifty dollars to five hundred dollars.
Michigan goes a step further and declares that anyone
violating the law shall forfeit to the State five hundred
dollars, to be recovered by the attorney general, and
that any officer or agent who violates it shall be guilty of
a misdemeanor and punished by imprisonment in the
county jail not over one year or by a fine of from fifty dollars
to five hundred dollars, or both.</p>

<p class='c007'>There must have been instances of discrimination by
life insurance companies against Negroes, else these States
would not have thought it necessary to enact such statutes.
The explanation of this discrimination is probably not so
much race prejudice as the general belief, based upon statistics,
that the Negro, particularly in the colder climate
of the North and West, has not the same hope of longevity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>as the white man, being more subject to pulmonary and
other mortal diseases. If the risk of mortality of the
Negro is greater, the insurance company argued that it
was justified in seeking compensation for assuming this
increased risk by charging a higher premium. No case
has been found arising under these statutes.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>RACE DISCRIMINATIONS BY LABOR UNIONS</h3>

<p class='c012'>The attitude of labor organizations toward Negroes has
of late been the subject of much comment, especially by the
Negroes themselves, who complain that they are handicapped
in the struggle for existence because of the hostility
of such organizations. Mr. Baker,<a id='r297' /><a href='#f297' class='c014'><sup>[297]</sup></a> speaking of the
North, said: “And yet, although I expected to find the
Negro wholly ostracised by union labor, I discovered that
where the Negro becomes numerous or skilful enough, he,
like the Italian or Russian Jew, begins to force his way
into the unions.... They have got in,&nbsp;... not because
they are wanted, or because they are liked, but because,
by being prepared, skilled, and energetic, the unions
have had to take them in as a matter of self-protection....
In several great industries North and South, indeed,
the Negro is as much a part of labor unionism as the white
man.” There seems to be more opposition to Negroes
joining the unions of Philadelphia than most Northern
cities.<a id='r298' /><a href='#f298' class='c014'><sup>[298]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>One would expect to find, where the conflict between
white and colored laborers exists, some evidence of it in
statutes or court reports. But this resolution of the General
Court of Massachusetts,<a id='r299' /><a href='#f299' class='c014'><sup>[299]</sup></a> passed in 1904, is the only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>trace that has been found: “<em>Whereas</em>, the national league
of American wheelmen, at their convention held in Louisville,
Kentucky, on the twentieth day of February, in the
present year, voted to exclude colored persons from membership
in said organization, which exclusion affects the
members of the organization resident in Massachusetts;
<em>Resolved</em>, That the General Court deprecates the action of
the organization above referred to, and regards the enforcement
of discriminations of this character as a revival of
baseless and obsolete prejudices.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>CHURCHES</h3>

<p class='c012'>Colorado is the only State that has undertaken by legislation
to guarantee to Negroes full and equal accommodations
in churches. The rest have left it to the churches
themselves to decide the matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is generally known that during slavery the Negroes,
for the most part, attended the white churches, where
galleries were set apart for them, were members thereof,
and were served by white ministers. After Emancipation,
the Negroes withdrew from the white churches and built
places of worship of their own. To-day, in all parts of the
country, where Negroes live in considerable numbers, they
have their own churches. In such cities as Boston, where
the doors of all churches are in theory open to every race,
Negro churches are found in the Negro districts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although there is practically race separation in the
churches of the whole country, all the difficulties have not
been solved. In 1903, the Freedman’s Aid and Southern
Educational Society, an organization of the bishops of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Methodist Episcopal Church, general secretaries of the
church department, and leading laymen, met in session
in Lincoln, Nebraska. Inasmuch as the purpose of this
body was to devise and discuss means of improving the
educational opportunities of the Southern Negroes, the
churchmen of that race were present in good numbers.
Some of the hotels in the city gave notice that they could
not allow the colored delegates to eat in the main dining
rooms, but that they could furnish them sleeping accommodations
and serve them meals in their apartments.<a id='r300' /><a href='#f300' class='c014'><sup>[300]</sup></a> It is
along this line that the difficulty usually comes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Baptist denomination recently organized the General
Baptist Convention of America, which held its first
meeting in St. Louis in 1905. The next meeting was to
have been in Louisville, Kentucky, May 5 and 16, 1906.
The executive committee of the convention postponed the
meeting for a year, assigning as their reason, or one of their
reasons, the fact that they experienced difficulty in securing
a church in which to hold the convention, the white
Baptists being averse to having the colored members of the
denomination assemble with them. It was arranged later
that the whites and Negroes should meet in the same edifice,
but that the Negroes should be restricted to the use of
the balconies. This, however, was resented by the Negroes.<a id='r301' /><a href='#f301' class='c014'><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Presbyterian Church also has had to face the race
problem. In its general assembly at Des Moines, Iowa, in
1906, the committee on church policies recommended the
erection of a synod in Alabama to include the presbyteries
of Birmingham, Levere, and Rogersville, which are composed
of colored churches. They had hitherto been included
in the synod of Tennessee. The report provoked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>such a discussion that it was carried over to the next meeting,
and no subsequent account has appeared.<a id='r302' /><a href='#f302' class='c014'><sup>[302]</sup></a> At the general
assembly of 1908, held in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, the
question arose again out of a report of the Board of Freedmen’s
Missions, some of the members from the North resenting
such a separation in the missionary efforts.<a id='r303' /><a href='#f303' class='c014'><sup>[303]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Episcopal Church has probably had the most difficulty
with the race problem. This Church has had no separate
organization for Negroes. Both races meet together
in the annual diocese conventions, without distinction, and
participate in the business of the Church. At one of these
conventions, held at Tarboro, North Carolina, in 1907, the
following resolution was passed: “That the time has come
when the welfare of both races in the Southern States requires
that each race should have its own ecclesiastical
legislative assemblies, and that we urge the General Convention
to take immediate action.” The colored clergy and
congregations had already expressed their willingness to
submit the whole matter to the general convention. In
speaking for separation, Bishop Cheshire, of North Carolina,
said: “I have come to this conclusion in spite of the
sentiments and convictions of a lifetime, and though my
mind and conscience compel my assent to this necessity,
my heart still clings to the old ideal of a church and a
diocese which in its annual gatherings should represent visibly
the oneness of all races and colors in Christ.... We
must confront the actual facts of the day. I believe that,
in one way or another, both the white race and the colored
race, consciously or unconsciously, demand a different arrangement
of our ecclesiastical institutions. I believe that
some separate organization for our colored work is coming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>in the near future.”<a id='r304' /><a href='#f304' class='c014'><sup>[304]</sup></a> At the general convention, which
met in Richmond, Virginia, in October, 1907, the question
of the separation of the races was much discussed, but
the actual outcome has not been learned. It developed in
the debate that the Southern bishops desired separation,
wishing to be relieved of the burden of the Negroes in
their dioceses, while the bishops from other sections preferred
the present arrangement, not desiring to be burdened
with a class of people not in their dioceses.<a id='r305' /><a href='#f305' class='c014'><sup>[305]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Young Men’s Christian Associations of the Northern
cities have to meet the problem of the Negro. The
New Haven, Connecticut, people refused to permit Negroes
to attend the Y. M. C. A., and a separate building had to
be provided for them.<a id='r306' /><a href='#f306' class='c014'><sup>[306]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Within the colored church itself there is manifest a conflict
between the Negroes proper and mulattoes. There is
a town in North Carolina in which they have practical separation
in the churches, the black Negroes going to one
church and the bright mulattoes to another. A similar separation
of the Negroes and mulattoes in churches exists,
to some extent, in Charleston, South Carolina. At a
Negro Christian Congress at Washington City, in 1906,
the chairman of the meeting was charged with removing
from the program dark-skinned men and substituting light-skinned
men. It provoked such a discussion as to divide
the meeting into two factions.<a id='r307' /><a href='#f307' class='c014'><sup>[307]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c013'>NEGROES IN THE MILITIA</h3>

<p class='c012'>The Brownsville affair—that is, the dismissal without
honor, through the order of President Roosevelt, of a
whole regiment of Negro soldiers because of the misconduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>of some of them and the refusal of the others to
testify against the guilty ones, and the championship of
the cause of the Negroes by Senator Foraker—has brought
into much prominence the question of the Negro as a soldier.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Southern States have been and are unfavorable to
allowing Negroes to serve in the militia. South Carolina,<a id='r308' /><a href='#f308' class='c014'><sup>[308]</sup></a>
in 1865, declared that persons of color constituted no part
of the militia of the State. Arkansas,<a id='r309' /><a href='#f309' class='c014'><sup>[309]</sup></a> in 1867, accorded
to Negroes all the rights of white citizens, with a few
exceptions, one of which was that nothing in the statute
should be construed as modifying any statute or common
law usage in the State respecting the service of Negroes
in the militia. North Carolina<a id='r310' /><a href='#f310' class='c014'><sup>[310]</sup></a> provided that white and
colored members of the detailed militia should not be compelled
to serve in the same companies. Georgia,<a id='r311' /><a href='#f311' class='c014'><sup>[311]</sup></a> in
1905, by statute, abolished the colored troops of the State,
active and retired, and discharged the officers and men
from the military service of the State.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is very little legislation on the subject in the
other States. In 1879, the legislature of Connecticut<a id='r312' /><a href='#f312' class='c014'><sup>[312]</sup></a>
authorized the commander-in-chief of the State militia to
organize four independent Negro companies of infantry
to be part of the National Guard. West Virginia,<a id='r313' /><a href='#f313' class='c014'><sup>[313]</sup></a> in
1889, provided that, if any colored troops should be organized,
they should be enlisted and kept separate and
apart from the other troops, and should be formed into
separate companies and regiments. New Jersey,<a id='r314' /><a href='#f314' class='c014'><sup>[314]</sup></a> in
1895, made provision for four companies of colored infantry,
presumably meaning that they should be all colored
and kept separate from the other troops.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>SEPARATION OF STATE DEPENDENTS</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Southern States, as a rule, require a separation by
race of inmates of State charitable and penal institutions,
and where it is not provided for by statute, it is done as
a matter of custom. Alabama,<a id='r315' /><a href='#f315' class='c014'><sup>[315]</sup></a> for instance, makes it
unlawful for any jailer or sheriff, having charge of white
and colored prisoners before conviction, to imprison them
permanently together in the same apartments of the jail
or other places of safe-keeping, if there are enough separate
apartments. It is also unlawful<a id='r316' /><a href='#f316' class='c014'><sup>[316]</sup></a> for white and
colored convicts to be chained together, allowed to sleep
together, or confined in the same room or apartment when
not at work.</p>

<p class='c007'>The legislature of Arkansas<a id='r317' /><a href='#f317' class='c014'><sup>[317]</sup></a> passed a statute in
1903, directing that in the State penitentiary and in all
county jails, stockades, convict camps, and all other places
where prisoners are confined, separate apartments should
be provided and maintained for white and Negro prisoners.
Separate bunks, beds, bedding, dining tables, and
other furnishings were required, and after they had once
been assigned to a prisoner of one race they must not be
changed to the use of one of the other race. White prisoners
must not be handcuffed or otherwise chained or
tied to a Negro prisoner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Georgia<a id='r318' /><a href='#f318' class='c014'><sup>[318]</sup></a> does not allow prison-keepers, or firms leasing
or controlling convicts, to confine white and colored
convicts together, or to work them chained together, or to
chain them together in going to and from their work or at
any other time. Mississippi<a id='r319' /><a href='#f319' class='c014'><sup>[319]</sup></a> provides that no discrimination
shall be made on account of race, color, or previous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>condition, in working convicts. This does not mean that
they shall not be separated, as they are in Georgia, but is
simply a prohibition against discrimination in the quality
of work assigned to the two races. At the last session
of the legislature of North Carolina,<a id='r320' /><a href='#f320' class='c014'><sup>[320]</sup></a> a bill was
passed providing for the separation of white and colored
prisoners in the State penitentiary and in the State
and county convict camps during sleeping and eating
hours.</p>

<p class='c007'>That a separation of the two races exists in the jails of
Washington City is evidenced by a protest issued a year
or so ago by the National Equal Rights Council of that
city, a Negro organization, against the separation of the
white and colored prisoners in the jails of the city. There
was no allegation, however, that the cells were not equal
in accommodation, the objection being raised solely at the
principle of separation.<a id='r321' /><a href='#f321' class='c014'><sup>[321]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>As to reformatories, Georgia<a id='r322' /><a href='#f322' class='c014'><sup>[322]</sup></a> provides that they
shall be so constructed as to keep white and colored inmates
separate. West Virginia<a id='r323' /><a href='#f323' class='c014'><sup>[323]</sup></a> requires that the white
and colored inmates of its reform school for boys shall be
kept separate, and the inmates of its industrial home for
girls (also a reformatory) shall be separate as far as
practicable.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to paupers, Alabama<a id='r324' /><a href='#f324' class='c014'><sup>[324]</sup></a> authorizes the county commissioners
of Washington County to keep separate accommodations
for the maintenance of white and colored
paupers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not many States have statutes which say in so many
words that lunatics, and that the deaf, mute, and blind
shall be kept separated according to race; but one finds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>appropriations for colored asylums and schools, etc., and
one is justified in concluding that, where a colored asylum
or school is built, the colored persons are not allowed in
the other asylums and schools of the State. Alabama,<a id='r325' /><a href='#f325' class='c014'><sup>[325]</sup></a>
for instance, has a school for the Negro deaf and blind
at Talladega, under the control and management of the
board of trustees of the white school for the deaf, and
makes an annual appropriation for the support of the
school. Arkansas<a id='r326' /><a href='#f326' class='c014'><sup>[326]</sup></a> also provides that applicants to the
deaf-mute asylums shall be received without restriction
on account of race or color, but does not forbid their separation
by race within the asylum. Tennessee,<a id='r327' /><a href='#f327' class='c014'><sup>[327]</sup></a> as early
as 1866, provided that there should be separate asylums for
the colored blind, deaf and dumb, and lunatics, and the
trustees of these institutions were given power to prepare
buildings for colored insane, “so as to keep them secure
and safe, and yet separate and apart from the white
patients.” In 1881, that State<a id='r328' /><a href='#f328' class='c014'><sup>[328]</sup></a> appropriated $25,000
to provide accommodations for the colored blind at Nashville,
and the same amount for the colored deaf and dumb
at Knoxville. Kentucky<a id='r329' /><a href='#f329' class='c014'><sup>[329]</sup></a> likewise provided in 1876 that
white and colored lunatics should not be kept in the same
building. New York<a id='r330' /><a href='#f330' class='c014'><sup>[330]</sup></a> has on many occasions made
appropriations for asylums for colored children, thus
leaving the impression that such children are not admitted
to the white asylums. North Carolina<a id='r331' /><a href='#f331' class='c014'><sup>[331]</sup></a> maintains separate
asylums for its white and colored insane. And
Georgia<a id='r332' /><a href='#f332' class='c014'><sup>[332]</sup></a> requires the asylums of the State to provide
apartments for the insane Negro residents of the State.
Indiana,<a id='r333' /><a href='#f333' class='c014'><sup>[333]</sup></a> in 1879, made an appropriation to associations
formed for the purpose of maintaining an asylum for colored
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>orphan children. The West Virginia<a id='r334' /><a href='#f334' class='c014'><sup>[334]</sup></a> asylum for
insane must have separate wards for white and colored
patients.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>SEPARATION OF RACES IN SCHOOLS</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'>BEREA COLLEGE AFFAIR</h3>

<p class='c012'>Three incidents, occurring during the past six years
under widely varying circumstances and in far separated
localities, have brought the question of the separation of
the white and colored races in schools into much prominence.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the 22d of March, 1904, the legislature of Kentucky<a id='r335' /><a href='#f335' class='c014'><sup>[335]</sup></a>
enacted the following statute:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sec. 1. That it shall be unlawful for any person,
corporation or association of persons to maintain or operate
any college, school or institution where persons of
the white and Negro races are both received as pupils for
instruction; and any person or corporation who shall
operate or maintain any such college, school or institution
shall be fined one thousand dollars, and any person or corporation
who may be convicted of violating the provisions
of this act shall be fined one hundred dollars for each day
they may operate said school, college or institution after
such conviction.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sec. 2. That any instructor who shall teach in any
school, college or institution where members of said two
races are received as pupils for instruction shall be guilty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>of operating and maintaining same and fined as provided
in the first section hereof.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sec. 3. It shall be unlawful for any white person to
attend any school or institution where Negroes are received
as pupils or receive instruction, and it shall be unlawful
for any Negro or colored person to attend any
school or institution where white persons are received as
pupils, or receive instruction. Any persons so offending
shall be fined fifty dollars for each day he attends such institution
or school: Provided, That the provisions of this
law shall not apply to any penal institution or house of
reform.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sec. 4. Nothing in this act shall be construed to prevent
any private school, college or institution of learning
from maintaining a separate and distinct branch thereof,
in a different locality, not less than twenty-five miles distant,
for the education exclusively of one race or color.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sec. 5. This act shall not take effect, or be in operation
before the fifteenth day of July, Nineteen Hundred and
Four.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This law was general in its terms, requiring, under
heavy penalty, the separation of the white and colored
races in all schools of the State, private as well as public.
But at the time of the consideration of the bill, the legislators
probably knew that there was only one school in the
State which admitted both white and colored students.
That was Berea College, which had been established about
fifty years before for the purpose of “promoting the cause
of Christ” and of giving general and nonsectarian instruction
to “all youth of good moral character.” It was primarily
for the benefit of the mountain whites of Kentucky,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Tennessee, Virginia, and the Carolinas. After the Civil
War, the doors of the school had been opened to Negroes,
and in 1904, Berea had a student-body of nine hundred
and twenty-seven, of whom one hundred and seventy-four
were Negroes.<a id='r336' /><a href='#f336' class='c014'><sup>[336]</sup></a> The President and Trustees of the college
protested against the enactment of the above law, but
to no avail. When the session of 1904–5 began, the colored
students were refused admission. The college at
once took steps to aid these Negro youths. It bore the
transportation expenses of about a hundred of them to
Fisk University, Knoxville College, Hampton Institute,
and other distinctly colored schools. The white
students left behind gave to the colored students leaving
Berea the following expression of their regard for
them:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Friends and Fellow-Students: As we meet for the
first time under new conditions to enjoy the great privileges
of Berea College, we think at once of you who are now
deprived of these privileges. Our sense of justice shows
us that others have the same rights as ourselves, and the
teaching of Christ leads us to ‘remember them that are in
bonds as bound with them.’</p>

<p class='c007'>“We realize that you are excluded from the class rooms
of Berea College, which we so highly prize, by no fault
of your own, and that this hardship is a part of a long line
of deprivations under which you live. Because you were
born in a race long oppressed and largely untaught and
undeveloped, heartless people feel more free to do you
wrong, and thoughtless people meet your attempts at self-improvement
with indifference or scorn. Even good people
sometimes fear to recognize your worth, or take your part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>in a neighborly way because of the violences and prejudices
around us.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are glad that we have known you, or known
about you, and that we know you are rising above all discouragements,
and showing a capacity and a character that
give promise for your people.... And you will always
have our friendship, and the friendship of the best people
throughout the world. We hope never to be afraid or
ashamed to show our approval of any colored person who
has the character and worth of most of the colored students
of Berea. We are glad that the college is providing funds
to assist you in continuing your education, and we are sure
the institution will find ways in which to do its full duty
by the colored race.”<a id='r337' /><a href='#f337' class='c014'><sup>[337]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>As might have been expected, the statute separating the
races in schools aroused much comment throughout the
country, the northern and eastern press being, as a rule,
hostile to it, the southern press coming to its defence.
Haste was made to have a test case involving the constitutionality
of the law heard. On June 12, 1906, the Kentucky
Court of Appeals in the case of Berea College v.
The Commonwealth<a id='r338' /><a href='#f338' class='c014'><sup>[338]</sup></a> upheld its constitutionality, being of
opinion that the law in question did not violate the Bill of
Rights of the State Constitution, because the requirement
of separation was a reasonable exercise of the police power
of the State, and did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment
by depriving Berea College of its property without
due process of law, because the right to teach white and
colored children in a private school at the same time and
place was not a property right, but the court added that that
part of the statute requiring a separate school for the other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>race, if established, to be at a distance of not less than
twenty-five miles, was unreasonable. The court took the
position that the white and black races are naturally antagonistic,
and that the enforced separation of the children
in schools is in line with the preservation of the peace.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Supreme Court of the United States,<a id='r339' /><a href='#f339' class='c014'><sup>[339]</sup></a> on November
9, 1908, affirmed the opinion of the State court. Mr. Justice
Brewer, however, placed his decision upon the ground
that the legislature has a right, by express reservation, to
amend the charter so long as the amendment does not defeat
or substantially impair the object of the grant under
the charter. Mr. Justice Harlan, in a dissenting opinion,
said the court should meet the entire question squarely and
decide whether it is a crime under any conditions to educate
white children and Negro children at the same institution.
He said that the Kentucky statute was void as an
arbitrary invasion of the rights of liberty and property
granted by the Fourteenth Amendment against unauthorized
State action. “Have we,” he asked, “become so inoculated
with prejudice of race that an American government,
professedly based on the principles of freedom, and
charged with the protection of all citizens alike, can make
distinction between such citizens in the matter of their
voluntary meeting for innocent purposes simply because of
their respective races? Further, if the lower court be right,
then a State may make it a crime for white and colored
persons to frequent the same market places at the same
time, or appear in an assemblage of citizens convened to
consider questions of a public or political nature in which
all citizens, without regard to race, are equally interested.
Many other illustrations might be given to show the mischievous,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>not to say cruel, character of the statute in question,
and how inconsistent such legislation is with the great
principle of the equality of citizens before the law.” Mr.
Justice Harlan added that he did not wish to be understood
as criticising the system of separate public schools
for the races, but that his censure was directed at the
penal provision of the Kentucky law involved in this case,
which he considered unconstitutional, and so vitiating the
whole statute.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>EXCLUSION OF JAPANESE FROM PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF SAN FRANCISCO</h3>

<p class='c012'>The second incident, which opened the question of the
separation of the races in schools and which led to international
comment, was the exclusion of the Japanese children
from the public schools of the city of San Francisco.
A law was enacted by the California Legislature<a id='r340' /><a href='#f340' class='c014'><sup>[340]</sup></a> on March
12, 1872, which provided that school trustees should have
the power to establish separate schools for Indian children
and for the children of Mongolian and Chinese descent,
and, when separate schools were furnished, to keep Indian,
Mongolian, and Chinese children from attending any
other school. The law was amended<a id='r341' /><a href='#f341' class='c014'><sup>[341]</sup></a> in 1880, 1885, 1891,
1893, 1895, and 1903, but the provision for separation
of the races remained essentially unchanged. This law
was not enforced until 1901, when the labor vote became
predominant. Then, according to Secretary Metcalf,<a id='r342' /><a href='#f342' class='c014'><sup>[342]</sup></a>
who investigated the conditions, the labor unionists began
a crusade to exclude the Japanese laborers from California,
as the Chinese had already been excluded. On May 6,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>1905, the Board of Education of San Francisco passed the
following resolution:</p>

<p class='c007'>“That the Board of Education is determined in its
efforts to effect the establishment of separate schools for
Chinese and Japanese pupils, not only for the purpose of
relieving the congestion at present prevailing in our
schools, but also for the higher end that our children should
not be placed in any position where their youthful impressions
may be affected by association with pupils of the
Mongolian race.” On October 1, 1906, the Board took the
next step and adopted this resolution: “That in accordance
with Article X, Section 1662, of the school law of California,
principals are hereby directed to send all Chinese,
Japanese or Korean children to the Oriental Public School,
situated on the south side of Cary street between Powell
and Mason streets, on and after Monday, October 15,
1906.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the day the latter rule went into effect there were
28,736 school children in San Francisco, of whom ninety-three
were Japanese distributed in twenty-three primary
and grammar schools of the city<a id='r343' /><a href='#f343' class='c014'><sup>[343]</sup></a> and nearly half the Japanese
children were in two of the twenty-three schools.
When the primary schools, except the Oriental, were closed
to the Japanese children the Japanese residents became
indignant. They appealed to their consul, and he, to their
ambassador at Washington. The latter, in turn, called on
the President, reporting the matter at the same time to the
home government. Alarmists began to talk of war with
Japan. President Roosevelt dispatched Secretary Metcalf
to California to make investigations. To use the President’s
words, “I authorized and directed Secretary Metcalf
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>to state that if there was failure to protect persons and
property, then the entire power of the Federal government
within the limits of the Constitution would be used
promptly and vigorously to enforce the observance of our
treaty, the supreme law of the land, which treaty guaranteed
to the Japanese residents everywhere in the Union full
and perfect protection for their persons and property, and
to this end everything in my power would be done, and all
the forces of the United States, both civil and military,
which I could lawfully employ, would be employed.”
Mayor Schmitz and a number of prominent men of the
city hurried across the continent to confer with the President.
A troublesome point of constitutional law was involved.
It was admitted that public education is distinctly
a State function. A treaty is declared by the Federal Constitution<a id='r344' /><a href='#f344' class='c014'><sup>[344]</sup></a>
to be the “supreme law of the land.” Is a
treaty the “supreme law of the land” in the sense that
the President or Supreme Court can treat as invalid a
State statute which contravenes it, or must the Federal
government bow in submission to that State statute even
though it is counter to a treaty obligation? The treaty of
1894 with Japan accorded to the Japanese residents in the
United States the rights and privileges of the “most favored
nation.” The State of California had declared that
Mongolian children, among which were Japanese, might, at
the discretion of the Board of Education, be required to go
to separate schools for their race. The children of the other
“most favored” nations were permitted to attend the
regular public schools. Is admission to the regular public
schools one of the rights and privileges guaranteed to Japanese
children by the treaty, which cannot be limited by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>State, or does the State of California, by its police power,
have a right to separate the school children by race, regardless
of national treaties? These questions, however,
did not have to be answered; before the crisis came, all
parties seemed to have arrived at a satisfactory compromise.
It was an agreement that all Japanese children not
over fourteen years of age should be readmitted to the
primary schools, and those over that age should be admitted
to the schools of higher grade, and the Japanese
coolie labor should be excluded. Thus was obviated what
at one time looked like the approach of an international
controversy over the separation of the races in schools.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the last session of the California legislature,
that of 1909, several bills concerning the Japanese were
introduced, one of which was as follows: “Every school,
unless otherwise provided by law, must be open for the
admission of all children between six and twenty-one years
of age residing in the district, and the Board of School
Trustees or city Board of Education have power to admit
adults and children not residing in the district whenever
good reasons exist therefor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Trustees shall have the power to remove children of
filthy or vicious habits or children suffering from contagious
or infectious diseases, and also to establish separate
schools for Indian children and for children of Mongolian
or Japanese or Chinese descent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When such separate schools are established, Indian,
Chinese, Japanese or Mongolian children must not be admitted
into any other school; provided, that in cities and
towns in which the kindergarten has been adopted, or may
hereafter be adopted as part of the public primary schools,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>children may be admitted to such kindergarten classes at
the age of four years; and provided further, that in cities
or school districts in which separate classes have been or
may hereafter be established for the instruction of the
deaf, children may be admitted to such classes at the age
of three years.” Practically the only difference between
this bill and the present law is the insertion of “Japanese.”<a id='r345' /><a href='#f345' class='c014'><sup>[345]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>President Roosevelt considered this and the other bills
of such serious import that he telegraphed to the Governor
of the State to use his influence to prevent enactments of
this nature. After a long fight the bill was killed. The
legislature made an appropriation for a census of the Japanese
in California in order to see just how serious the
problem was.<a id='r346' /><a href='#f346' class='c014'><sup>[346]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The people along the Canadian Pacific coast are facing
a question similar to that in California. A member of
the provincial Parliament from Manaimo, British Columbia,
has recently given notice that he will introduce a
measure providing for the exclusion of Oriental children
from public schools, declaring that his purpose is to compel
the government to maintain separate schools.<a id='r347' /><a href='#f347' class='c014'><sup>[347]</sup></a></p>

<h3 class='c013'>DR. CHARLES W. ELIOT ON SEPARATION OF RACES IN SCHOOLS</h3>

<p class='c012'>The third incident referred to, though not a matter of
legislation, did much to focus the attention of the country
at large upon the question of the separation of the races
in schools. The Twentieth Century Club of Boston met at
luncheon on the 14th of February, 1907, to consider the
situation of Berea College. Dr. Charles W. Eliot, then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>President of Harvard University, was one of the speakers.
In the course of his remarks, he said: “If the numbers of
whites and blacks were more nearly equal [in Boston] we
might feel like segregating the one from the other in our
own schools. It may be that as large and generous a work
can be done for the Negro in this way as in mixed schools.
So the separation of the races in the Berea schools is not
really an abandonment of the principle, although it may
be a departure from the original purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps if there were as many Negroes here as there
we might think it better for them to be in separate schools.
At present Harvard has about five thousand white students
and about thirty of the colored race. The latter are hidden
in the great mass and are not noticeable. If they were
equal in numbers or in a majority, we might deem a separation
necessary.”<a id='r348' /><a href='#f348' class='c014'><sup>[348]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>These conservative and guarded words of the head of
the University which has, above all other American institutions
of learning, preserved and encouraged the “open-door
policy” toward students of all races, struck consternation
to the radicals of both the white and colored races in
the North and East, and gladdened the hearts of many of
the South and West who are facing their own race problems.
One side felt that it had lost an illustrious standard-bearer;
the other, that it had won a strong ally.</p>

<p class='c007'>These three incidents show that the separation of the
races in schools is a live question, worthy of an investigation.
It is probable that there are many private and public
schools outside of the South which do not, in fact, admit
colored students. Probably there are schools which would
close their doors to white applicants. It may be that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>are actual discriminations against one or the other race
in those schools which claim to make no distinction on
account of race or color. But many such matters as these
have not come under the eye of the law, and so have no
place here.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SEPARATION BEFORE 1865</h3>

<p class='c012'>Although one need not consider in detail the laws
separating the races in schools before the Civil War, because
the public school system then was poorly developed,
as a rule, and the Negro had not attained the rights of a
citizen in many States, still it is well to look into some of
the antebellum statutes and decisions to find precedents
for later statutes and rulings of the courts upon this
subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Ohio, prior to 1848, no provision was made for the
public education of colored children, and the property of
colored persons was not taxed for school purposes. In fact,
a law<a id='r349' /><a href='#f349' class='c014'><sup>[349]</sup></a> of February 10, 1829, expressly excluded black and
mulattoes from the public schools. In 1834, the child of
a man three-quarters white and of a white woman was denied
admission to a public school. In a case<a id='r350' /><a href='#f350' class='c014'><sup>[350]</sup></a> arising out
of it, the court held that a child with more than one-half
white blood is entitled to the privilege of the whites, saying:
“We think the term white as used in the law describes
<em>blood</em> and not <em>complexion</em>.... The plaintiff’s children,
therefore, are white within the meaning of the law, though
the defendants have had the shabby meanness to ask from
him his contribution of tax, and exclude his children from
the benefit of the school he helped to support.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1848, a law<a id='r351' /><a href='#f351' class='c014'><sup>[351]</sup></a> of the same State provided for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>levy of a tax upon the property of colored persons for the
support of colored schools, if the objection was made to the
admission of colored children into white schools. It prohibited
the application of any part of the tax paid by white
persons to the support of colored schools unless the whites
assented thereto. A law having so many options was objectionable
and was repealed within a year. The next year,
1849, a statute<a id='r352' /><a href='#f352' class='c014'><sup>[352]</sup></a> was enacted with regard to the education
of colored children, but this appropriated to the colored
schools only the funds arising from taxes paid by colored
persons. The year before the white patron of a school had
brought an action against the directors because they
erroneously admitted colored children to the school, thus
contriving, he said, “to deprive him of the benefit” of
sending his children to the school. The court<a id='r353' /><a href='#f353' class='c014'><sup>[353]</sup></a> ruled that
the directors were not liable because they did not act with
corrupt motives, but had simply misjudged the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>The law of 1849 gave rise to a difficulty. The Constitution
of Ohio, by restricting the electorate to white persons,
had provided that those entrusted with any power connected
with the government of the State should be white
persons. Are school directors entrusted with any governmental
power? The court<a id='r354' /><a href='#f354' class='c014'><sup>[354]</sup></a> held that they are not, in the
sense of the Constitution, and that colored persons might
be directors of colored schools. A statute<a id='r355' /><a href='#f355' class='c014'><sup>[355]</sup></a> of 1853 repealed
that of 1849 and provided for a division of the public
school funds in proportion to the number of children of
school age, regardless of color. But separate schools were
still maintained. Under this law, it was held<a id='r356' /><a href='#f356' class='c014'><sup>[356]</sup></a> that the
children of three-eighths African and five-eighths white
blood, who were distinctly colored and generally treated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>and regarded as colored children by the community wherein
they resided, should not be, as of right, entitled to admission
into white schools.<a id='r357' /><a href='#f357' class='c014'><sup>[357]</sup></a> In 1841, it had been held
that a youth of Negro, Indian, and white blood, but of
more than half white blood, was entitled to the benefit of
the school fund.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Indiana,<a id='r358' /><a href='#f358' class='c014'><sup>[358]</sup></a> in 1850, the public school law provided
for a tax levy for the support of the schools, but omitted “all
Negroes and mulattoes” from the tax list. Some colored
children applied for admission, not as beneficiaries of the
public school fund, but offering to pay their own tuition.
The court<a id='r359' /><a href='#f359' class='c014'><sup>[359]</sup></a> of that State held that they could not be received
if the resident parents of white children attending or
desiring to attend the school objected, saying: “This [the
exclusion of the colored children] has not been done because
they do not need education, nor because their wealth
was such as to render aid undesirable, but because black
children were deemed unfit associates of white, as school
companions. Now, surely, this reason operates with equal
force against such children attending the schools at their
own, as at the public expense.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of Roberts v. The City of Boston,<a id='r360' /><a href='#f360' class='c014'><sup>[360]</sup></a> which
was argued before the Supreme Court of Massachusetts
in 1849, in which Charles Sumner was counsel for the
plaintiff, the court gives the following interesting information:
“The colored population of Boston constitute less
than one sixty-second part of the entire population of the
city. For half a century, separate schools have been kept
in Boston for colored children, and the primary school for
colored children in Belknap street was established in 1820,
and has been kept there ever since. The teachers of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>school have the same compensation and qualifications as in
other like schools in the city. Schools for colored children
were originally established at the request of colored citizens,
whose children could not attend the public schools, on
account of the prejudice then existing against them....</p>

<p class='c007'>“In 1846, George Putnam and other colored citizens
of Boston petitioned the primary school committee that
exclusive schools for colored children might be abolished,
and the committee, on the 22d of June, 1846, adopted the
report of a sub-committee, and a resolution appended
thereto, which was in the following words:</p>

<p class='c007'>“‘Resolved, that in the opinion of this board, the continuance
of the separate schools for colored children, and
the regular attendance of all such children upon the school,
is not only legal and just, but is best adapted to promote
the education of that class of our population.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>At the time of this case, there were one hundred and
sixty primary schools in Boston, of which two were set
apart for colored children. The facts of the case were
these: A colored child applied for admission to a white
school on the ground that the colored primary school was
one-fifth of a mile farther from her home. The general
school committee refused her admission, and the colored
girl, through her father, sued the city of Boston. The
Supreme Court upheld the power of the committee to provide
separate schools for colored children and prohibit
their attendance at other schools. The court also said: “It
is urged, that this maintenance of separate schools tends
to deepen and perpetuate the odious distinction of caste,
founded in a deep-rooted prejudice in public opinion. This
prejudice, if it exists, is not created by law, and probably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>cannot be changed by law. Whether this distinction and
prejudice, existing in the opinion and feelings of the community,
would not be as effectually fostered by compelling
colored and white children to associate together in the same
schools, may well be doubted; at all events, it is a fair and
proper question for the committee to consider and decide
upon, having in view the best interests of both classes of
children placed under their superintendence, and we cannot
say, that their decision upon it is not founded on just
grounds of reason and experience, and in the results of a
discriminating and honest judgment.” This line of argument
is familiar to those who have studied the decisions
of Southern courts upon the separation of the races in
schools, in public conveyances, hotels, theatres, and other
public places.</p>

<p class='c007'>The attitude of the courts and legislatures of Indiana,
Ohio, and Massachusetts, not one of which is a Southern
State, toward the association of white and colored school
children shows that there was ample precedent for the laws
of the postbellum period. It is probable that a careful
examination of the annual statutes of the other States before
1865 would reveal that separation was required in
them also; that is, where any provision at all was made
for the public instruction of Negroes. For instance, the
law in Delaware<a id='r361' /><a href='#f361' class='c014'><sup>[361]</sup></a> in 1852 was that the public school should
be free to all white children of the district over five years
old. The inference to be drawn is that colored children
were excluded.</p>

  <h3 class='c013'>PRESENT EXTENT OF SEPARATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c011'>(<em>a</em>) <em>In South</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>It is a matter of general knowledge that white and colored
children are not permitted to attend the same public
schools in the South. The separation is required both by
State Constitutions and statutes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Constitutions of Alabama of 1875<a id='r362' /><a href='#f362' class='c014'><sup>[362]</sup></a> and 1901<a id='r363' /><a href='#f363' class='c014'><sup>[363]</sup></a>
provide for a system of public schools, but add that separate
schools must be maintained for white and colored
children. The laws<a id='r364' /><a href='#f364' class='c014'><sup>[364]</sup></a> of 1868 have this provision: “In
no case shall it be lawful to unite in one school both colored
and white children, unless it be by the unanimous
consent of the parents and guardians of such children; but
said trustees shall in all other cases provide separate
schools for both white and colored children.” The separation
is also required in the laws of 1878<a id='r365' /><a href='#f365' class='c014'><sup>[365]</sup></a> and 1884.<a id='r366' /><a href='#f366' class='c014'><sup>[366]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Arkansas has no constitutional provision as to separation,
but an act<a id='r367' /><a href='#f367' class='c014'><sup>[367]</sup></a> of 1867 reads: “No Negro or mulatto
shall be permitted to attend any public school in this State,
except such schools as may be established exclusively for
colored persons.” And a statute of 1873<a id='r368' /><a href='#f368' class='c014'><sup>[368]</sup></a> declares that
the board of education must provide separate schools.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Constitution<a id='r369' /><a href='#f369' class='c014'><sup>[369]</sup></a> of Florida of 1887 provides that
white and colored children shall not be taught in the same
school, but that impartial provision shall be made for both.
A statute<a id='r370' /><a href='#f370' class='c014'><sup>[370]</sup></a> of 1895, which will be considered later, makes
it a penal offence to educate white and Negro children in
the same schools, whether public or private or parochial.</p>

<p class='c007'>Under a Georgia statute<a id='r371' /><a href='#f371' class='c014'><sup>[371]</sup></a> of 1866, any free white citizen
between the ages of six and twenty-one years and any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>disabled and indigent soldier of the State under the age
of thirty might have instruction in the schools free of
charge. This would seem to leave out the colored children.
But the Constitution<a id='r372' /><a href='#f372' class='c014'><sup>[372]</sup></a> of 1877 requires separate schools;
so do the laws of 1872.<a id='r373' /><a href='#f373' class='c014'><sup>[373]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The laws of Kentucky<a id='r374' /><a href='#f374' class='c014'><sup>[374]</sup></a> of 1870 provided that it
should be the duty of the trustees of the common schools
of that State to invite and encourage indigent white children
in the district to attend the school, and to inform
them and their parents that such was their right for which
the State paid, though they themselves might contribute
toward paying the expenses of the school. The annual report
of the trustees must always show that this duty had
been performed; and no arrangement should be made for
the benefit of some individuals of this description to the
exclusion of others. Again, apparently no provision was
made for the colored children, but the Constitution<a id='r375' /><a href='#f375' class='c014'><sup>[375]</sup></a> of
1891 declares that in the distribution of the school fund
no distinction shall be made on account of race or color,
but that separate schools must be maintained. The statute<a id='r376' /><a href='#f376' class='c014'><sup>[376]</sup></a>
of 1904, under which the Berea College case arose,
applies to both public and private schools and requires a
separation of the races in both.</p>

<p class='c007'>The government of Louisiana was early in the hands
of the Reconstructionists, as its statutes show. The Constitution<a id='r377' /><a href='#f377' class='c014'><sup>[377]</sup></a>
of 1868 said: “There shall be no separate
schools or institutions of learning established exclusively
for any race by the State of Louisiana.” A separation of
the races in schools had been required by the Constitutions
of 1845<a id='r378' /><a href='#f378' class='c014'><sup>[378]</sup></a> and 1852,<a id='r379' /><a href='#f379' class='c014'><sup>[379]</sup></a> which makes this provision of the
Constitution of 1868 all the more significant. In 1871
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>provision was made for an institution for the instruction
of the blind, and an industrial home for the blind at Baton
Rouge. The statute<a id='r380' /><a href='#f380' class='c014'><sup>[380]</sup></a> relative to these concluded thus:
“... no part of this act shall be construed so as to deprive
any person on account of race or color of the privilege
of admittance to the institution.” A law<a id='r381' /><a href='#f381' class='c014'><sup>[381]</sup></a> of 1875
which established an agricultural and mechanical college
provided that there should be no discrimination of race or
color in the admission, management, or discipline of the
institution. The Constitution of 1879 did not expressly
prohibit the separation of the races in schools, as that of
1868 had done, but on the other hand it did not require
separation. It seems, rather, to have left the matter in the
hands of the legislature. The first reference made to separate
schools was in 1880, when a university was established
for the education of persons of color, called the
Southern University, four of the twelve trustees of which
were to be Negroes.<a id='r382' /><a href='#f382' class='c014'><sup>[382]</sup></a> Finally, the Constitution<a id='r383' /><a href='#f383' class='c014'><sup>[383]</sup></a> of 1898
requires the general assembly to establish free public
schools for the white and colored races.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Maryland statute<a id='r384' /><a href='#f384' class='c014'><sup>[384]</sup></a> of 1870 declared that all the
taxes paid for school purposes by the colored people in any
county or in the city of Baltimore, together with donations
for that purpose, should be set aside for maintaining
schools for colored children. The school commissioners
were given power to make further appropriations as they
should deem proper to assist the colored schools. A law<a id='r385' /><a href='#f385' class='c014'><sup>[385]</sup></a>
of 1872 provided that the school commissioners should
establish one or more public schools in each election district
for colored children, which must be kept open as long
as the other public schools of the county were kept open.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>They are subject to the same laws and must furnish instruction
in the same branches as the white schools. The
taxes paid for school purposes by colored persons must be
devoted to the maintenance of colored schools. This is
the Maryland law,<a id='r386' /><a href='#f386' class='c014'><sup>[386]</sup></a> in substance, as it exists at present,
except that a separate school does not have to be provided
in each election district unless the colored population in
that district warrants the board in establishing a colored
school. Where there are not enough Negroes in a district
to have a school of their own, presumably, they go to the
colored schools in neighboring districts.</p>

<p class='c007'>As early as 1878 a statute of Mississippi<a id='r387' /><a href='#f387' class='c014'><sup>[387]</sup></a> provided
that schools should be arranged in each county so as to
afford ample free school facilities for all educable youths
in the county, prohibiting the teaching of white and colored
pupils in the same school-house, and the Constitution<a id='r388' /><a href='#f388' class='c014'><sup>[388]</sup></a>
of 1890 reiterated this requirement of separation.
The county school boards are given power to locate one or
more schools for Indians in counties where there are
enough Indians to form a school.<a id='r389' /><a href='#f389' class='c014'><sup>[389]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Missouri seems not to have lost an opportunity to
express its belief in separate schools for the races. The
Constitution<a id='r390' /><a href='#f390' class='c014'><sup>[390]</sup></a> of 1865 made that requirement, adding that
the school fund must be appropriated in proportion to the
number of children without regard to color. Such separation
is required by the laws of 1865,<a id='r391' /><a href='#f391' class='c014'><sup>[391]</sup></a> of 1868,<a id='r392' /><a href='#f392' class='c014'><sup>[392]</sup></a> of
1869,<a id='r393' /><a href='#f393' class='c014'><sup>[393]</sup></a> by the Constitution of 1875,<a id='r394' /><a href='#f394' class='c014'><sup>[394]</sup></a> and by a law of
1889,<a id='r395' /><a href='#f395' class='c014'><sup>[395]</sup></a> which last made it unlawful for colored children
to attend a white school, or white children, a colored school.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Constitution of North Carolina<a id='r396' /><a href='#f396' class='c014'><sup>[396]</sup></a> of 1875 declares
that “the children of the white and the children of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>colored shall be taught in separate public schools, but there
shall be no discrimination made in favor of, or to the prejudice
of either race.” According to the statute<a id='r397' /><a href='#f397' class='c014'><sup>[397]</sup></a> of 1901,
a child descended from a Negro to the third generation
inclusive should not attend a white school. This was
amended<a id='r398' /><a href='#f398' class='c014'><sup>[398]</sup></a> in 1903 to the effect that no child with Negro
blood in his veins, “however remote the strain,” shall
attend a school for the white race. The present statute<a id='r399' /><a href='#f399' class='c014'><sup>[399]</sup></a>
also provides that the descendants of Croatan Indians now
living in Robeson and Richmond counties shall have separate
schools for their children. It will be remembered
that it is the Croatan Indians who are prohibited from
intermarrying with Negroes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Territory of Oklahoma<a id='r400' /><a href='#f400' class='c014'><sup>[400]</sup></a> had the following peculiar
arrangement for separate schools till 1901: In each
county an election was held every three years at which
all the qualified school electors could vote for or against
the maintenance of separate schools in that county. If a
majority voted against separation, then the white and colored
children might attend the same school; but if a majority
voted for separation separate schools had to be provided.
In counties which separate schools were voted in
the schools for whites and blacks had to be equal in length
of terms and in facilities. Any failure to comply with the
law rendered the act for establishing separate schools void,
and immediately the schools were opened to both races.
In 1901<a id='r401' /><a href='#f401' class='c014'><sup>[401]</sup></a> separate schools were required all over the Territory.
In case the children of one race in a district did
not exceed ten, they were to be transferred to a school for
their race in another district instead of a separate school
being maintained for them, provided the distance was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>over two miles and a half. The white and colored schools
were to be furnished with the same kind of furniture and
equipment. No white teacher should teach in a colored
school and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</span></i>. The Constitution<a id='r402' /><a href='#f402' class='c014'><sup>[402]</sup></a> of the State of
Oklahoma, adopted September 17, 1907, provides: “Separate
schools for white and colored children, with like accommodation,
shall be provided by the legislature and
impartially maintained. The term ‘colored children,’ as
used in this section, shall be construed to mean children
of African descent. The term ‘white children’ shall include
all other children.” An Oklahoma statute<a id='r403' /><a href='#f403' class='c014'><sup>[403]</sup></a> of 1907
requires complete separation of the races in schools, with
impartial facilities for both races. By “colored children,”
it means those that have any “quantum of Negro blood.”
The teacher who knowingly and willingly permits a child
of one race to be taught in a school for another race is
guilty of a misdemeanor, and may be punished by a fine
of between ten and a hundred dollars and, in addition,
may have his certificate cancelled and be unable to secure
another for a year. The separation applies to private
schools and colleges as well as public schools.</p>

<p class='c007'>The South Carolina government was, like that of
Louisiana, early under Reconstruction. The Constitution<a id='r404' /><a href='#f404' class='c014'><sup>[404]</sup></a>
of 1868 provided that “all the public schools, colleges
and universities of this State, supported in whole or
in part by the public school fund, should be free and open
to all the children and youths of that State, without regard
to race or color.” In fact, the University of South Carolina
was open to Negroes directly after the War.<a id='r405' /><a href='#f405' class='c014'><sup>[405]</sup></a> But
the Constitution<a id='r406' /><a href='#f406' class='c014'><sup>[406]</sup></a> of 1895 requires separate schools, and
adds that “no child of either race shall ever be permitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>to attend a school provided for children of the other race.”
The Negro public schools of the city of Charleston are
taught by white people, mostly Southern-born white people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tennessee, by its laws<a id='r407' /><a href='#f407' class='c014'><sup>[407]</sup></a> of 1866, by its Constitution<a id='r408' /><a href='#f408' class='c014'><sup>[408]</sup></a>
of 1870, and by its laws<a id='r409' /><a href='#f409' class='c014'><sup>[409]</sup></a> of 1873 requires separate public
schools for the white and colored children. A statute<a id='r410' /><a href='#f410' class='c014'><sup>[410]</sup></a>
of 1901 prohibits the co-education of the white and colored
races in private schools.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Texas Constitution<a id='r411' /><a href='#f411' class='c014'><sup>[411]</sup></a> of 1876 provided for separate
schools and impartial accommodations for both races.
A school-house constructed in part by voluntary subscription
by colored parents and guardians and for a colored
school community shall not be used without their consent

a school which receives both white and colored pupils shall

<p class='c007'>The Constitution of Virginia of 1870 did not declare
that the races must be separated in schools. But statutes
of 1882<a id='r416' /><a href='#f416' class='c014'><sup>[416]</sup></a> and 1896<a id='r417' /><a href='#f417' class='c014'><sup>[417]</sup></a> provide that white and colored persons
shall not be taught in the same school but in separate
schools, under the same general regulations as to management,
usefulness, and efficiency. The Virginia Constitution<a id='r418' /><a href='#f418' class='c014'><sup>[418]</sup></a>
of 1902 has the terse statement that white and colored
children shall not be taught in the same school.</p>

  <h4 class='c011'>(<em>b</em>) <em>In States Outside of South</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Besides the Southern States, which have just been considered,
there are other States which require or permit a
separation of the races in schools. The separation of the
white and Japanese children in the public schools of San
Francisco has already been discussed. That was only a
part of the legislation of California. A statute<a id='r419' /><a href='#f419' class='c014'><sup>[419]</sup></a> enacted
during the session of 1869–70 read: “The education of
children of African descent and Indian children shall be
provided for in separate schools. Upon the written application
of the parents or guardians of at least ten such children
to the board of trustees or board of education, a separate
school shall be established for the education of such
children; and the education of a less number may be provided
for by the trustees in separate schools in any other
manner.” In 1874 a Negro child was refused admission
to a white school in that State. In a test case which arose
the constitutionality of the statute was supported, the
court<a id='r420' /><a href='#f420' class='c014'><sup>[420]</sup></a> being of opinion that the statute did not violate
the Fourteenth Amendment if appropriate schools for colored
children were maintained. But, it added, unless such
separate schools are actually maintained, colored children
must be admitted to the regular public schools along with
the white children. This latter ruling became part of a
statute of 1880. Prior to 1880 the law had been that
“every school, unless otherwise provided by law, must be
open for the admission of all white children....” This
was amended in 1880<a id='r421' /><a href='#f421' class='c014'><sup>[421]</sup></a> by the omission of the word
“white” and by repealing the sections providing for Negro
and Indian schools. On the strength of this amendment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>a Negro, upon being refused admission to the white schools,
brought suit,<a id='r422' /><a href='#f422' class='c014'><sup>[422]</sup></a> and it was held that, as the law stood, colored
children had equal rights with white children to admission
to any public school, even though separate schools
were maintained. The court said: “The whole policy of
the legislative department of the government upon this
matter is easily gathered from the course of legislation
shown therein; and there can be no doubt but that it was
never intended that, as a matter of classification of pupils,
the right to establish separate schools for children of African
descent, and thereby to exclude them from white schools&nbsp;... should be given to such boards [of education].” It
was earlier, in 1872, that the provision for separate schools
for Mongolians was made. The law of California seems
now to be that Negro children may attend the same schools
as whites, but Japanese, Chinese, and Korean children
must go to separate schools if the board of education sees
fit to provide them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The legislature of Delaware,<a id='r423' /><a href='#f423' class='c014'><sup>[423]</sup></a> in 1881, appropriated
two thousand four hundred dollars annually for the education
of colored children. In 1889 three colored schools<a id='r424' /><a href='#f424' class='c014'><sup>[424]</sup></a>
were incorporated and placed in control of boards of trustees
elected by the voters of the district. These incorporated
schools<a id='r425' /><a href='#f425' class='c014'><sup>[425]</sup></a> as such were abolished in 1893, and after
that they were placed under the supervision of the regular
county superintendent just as the other public schools.
The same State,<a id='r426' /><a href='#f426' class='c014'><sup>[426]</sup></a> in 1898, provided for the establishment
of separate kindergartens. Thus, Delaware is as strict as
the Southern States in requiring separate schools for the
races.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the Illinois statutes<a id='r427' /><a href='#f427' class='c014'><sup>[427]</sup></a> clearly state that any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>school officer who excludes from a public school any child
on account of color shall be fined from five dollars to one
hundred dollars for each offence, and prohibits school directors
and officers from excluding, directly or indirectly, children
on account of color, still the numerous cases which
have arisen involving the point show that the school officers
have not always been in thorough agreement with
the law.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1874 the school directors of McLean County, Illinois,
erected a separate school building, twelve by fourteen feet,
for the exclusive purpose of educating the three or four
colored children in the district therein. It was admitted
that there was plenty of room for them in the regular
school building. One of the taxpayers of the district petitioned
for an injunction against the building of the house,
but it was completed before any decision was rendered. In
a case which arose later, the court<a id='r428' /><a href='#f428' class='c014'><sup>[428]</sup></a> held that the school
directors had no right to make such a discrimination
against Negroes, and that any taxpayer might object. In
1882 the board of education of Quincy, Illinois, divided the
city into eight districts and set apart one school for Negroes.
A case arising over this division and segregation,
the court<a id='r429' /><a href='#f429' class='c014'><sup>[429]</sup></a> ruled that, in the absence of State legislation,
the board had no power to establish separate schools for
Negroes. In 1886 the school board of Upper Alton passed
a resolution excluding colored children from the white
school unless they had reached the high school grade. A
Negro, whose children below high school grade were refused
admission to the white school, brought suit, and the
court<a id='r430' /><a href='#f430' class='c014'><sup>[430]</sup></a> held that the school board had no power to separate
the children on account of color. In 1899 the common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>council of Alton established a school for Negroes, but
the court<a id='r431' /><a href='#f431' class='c014'><sup>[431]</sup></a> held that this involved an illegal discrimination
against them. The Associated Press report<a id='r432' /><a href='#f432' class='c014'><sup>[432]</sup></a> of November
28, 1906, had the following statement: “East St.
Louis, Ill., Nov. 28, 1906—A large brick building at 1,400
Missouri avenue, which was leased last week by the Board
of Education for a Negro school, was destroyed by fire
to-day, and there is evidence that prejudice against the
establishment of a school for Negroes caused the building
to be set on fire. Late last night the building was discovered
to be on fire, but prompt action saved it. The firemen
found rags soaked in oil on the second floor hallway.
The destruction of the building to-day makes the second
building leased for a Negro school that has been burned
within the last two weeks.” The latest Illinois case on the
subject is that of April 23, 1908, The People v. The Mayor,
etc., of Alton.<a id='r433' /><a href='#f433' class='c014'><sup>[433]</sup></a> A Negro’s children were excluded from
the public school most convenient to them and directed
to a colored school less convenient. He petitioned for a
writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mandamus</span></i> against the mayor and common council
to compel them to admit his children to the most convenient
school, and after the case had been tried seven
times by juries in the circuit court, the writ was finally
granted by the Supreme Court. Although all of these
cases were decided against race separation they show that
there is still an appreciable feeling in Illinois against the
white and colored children being taught in the same
schools. The trouble at Alton is not yet over. After a
fourteen years’ fight the Negroes won, as has been seen, before
the Supreme Court of the State. But when the Negro
children applied for admission to the public schools, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>were again refused. Before the schools were opened for
the session of 1908–09, many of the Negroes were visited
and induced to send their children to the four Negro
schools built in Alton. But forty other Negroes filed a
petition for a writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mandamus</span></i> against the mayor and
council of Alton seeking to have them answer why they
refused to obey the mandate of the Supreme Court of
the State.<a id='r434' /><a href='#f434' class='c014'><sup>[434]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A statute<a id='r435' /><a href='#f435' class='c014'><sup>[435]</sup></a> of Indiana of 1869 required the trustees
of schools to organize separate but equal schools for
Negroes. If there were not enough Negroes in the district
for a school, two or more districts might be consolidated
for that purpose. If there were not enough within a reasonable
distance, then the trustees might provide such
other means of education of colored children as would employ
their proportion of the school fund to the best advantage.
A case<a id='r436' /><a href='#f436' class='c014'><sup>[436]</sup></a> testing the constitutionality of this law,
which arose in 1874, is one of the most exhaustive cases
on the subject. The father of Negro children applied for
a mandate to compel the admission of them to white
schools. The court held that the separation of the races
in schools is not in violation of the Federal or the State
Constitution. The common schools, it was said, are based
upon State legislation, are domestic institutions, and, as
such, subject to the exclusive control of the constituted
authorities of the State. The Federal Constitution does
not provide for any general system of education to be conducted
and controlled by the national government, nor
does it vest in Congress any power to exercise a general or
special supervision over the State on the subject of education.
Under the Constitution of Indiana the common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>school system must be general, uniform, and equally open
to all, but uniformity will be secured where all schools of
the same grade have the same system of government and
discipline, the same branches of learning taught, and the
same qualifications for admission. The court said: “In
our opinion the classification of scholars on the basis of
race or color, and their education in separate schools, involve
questions of domestic policy which are within the
legislative discretion and control, and do not amount to
an exclusion of either class&nbsp;... there would be as much
lawful reason for complaint by one scholar in the same
school that he could not occupy the seat of another scholar
therein at the same time the latter occupied it, or by scholars
in different classes in the same school, that they were
not placed in the same class, or by scholars in different
schools, that they were not all placed in the same school, as
there is that black and white children are placed in distinct
classes and taught in separate schools.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1877, the Indiana law of 1869 was amended<a id='r437' /><a href='#f437' class='c014'><sup>[437]</sup></a> so
that the school directors <em>might</em> (not <em>must</em>) organize separate
schools for the races. In case a colored school was
not provided, the colored children should be allowed to
attend the regular white school. When the colored child
had reached a grade higher than that taught in the colored
school, he must be admitted to the regular high school, and
no distinction therein should be made on account of race
or color. In 1882, there were only about six Negro children
in a certain district, and the trustees were indicted
for not establishing a separate school for them. The
court<a id='r438' /><a href='#f438' class='c014'><sup>[438]</sup></a> ruled that it was impracticable to maintain a
separate school for so small a number. In 1883, a Negro
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>pupil brought suit on the ground that he was not admitted
to the white high school, under the law of 1877, but he
did not show that he had passed the required examination.
The court<a id='r439' /><a href='#f439' class='c014'><sup>[439]</sup></a> held that the discretion as to the competency
of the child is a matter for the board of education, not
the court.</p>

<p class='c007'>The laws of Iowa have not since 1865 required or permitted
a separation of the races in schools. In 1868, a
Negro girl, denied admission to the graded schools of Muscatine,
brought suit, and the court<a id='r440' /><a href='#f440' class='c014'><sup>[440]</sup></a> gave relief, saying
that the school directors could not require Negroes to attend
separate schools; that if separate schools for Negroes
are prescribed, the same might as well be done for German,
Irish, and French children. The same principle has been
affirmed in subsequent decisions which show that there
have been instances in that State of school boards trying
to separate the races.<a id='r441' /><a href='#f441' class='c014'><sup>[441]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>By the statutes<a id='r442' /><a href='#f442' class='c014'><sup>[442]</sup></a> of Kansas of 1868 the boards of education
of cities of the first class—that is, cities of over
150,000 inhabitants—had the “power to organize and
maintain separate schools for the education of white and
colored children.” This power was omitted in a revision
of the school law<a id='r443' /><a href='#f443' class='c014'><sup>[443]</sup></a> in 1876, and consequently repealed by
implication. But in 1879 a statute<a id='r444' /><a href='#f444' class='c014'><sup>[444]</sup></a> was passed amending
the school law, which revived the power to separate the
races in cities of the first class “except in the high school,
where no discrimination shall be made on account of
color.” The constitutionality of this statute was upheld
by the Supreme Court<a id='r445' /><a href='#f445' class='c014'><sup>[445]</sup></a> of Kansas in 1903, and again in
1909. The State has not given this power of separation
to cities of the second class, so the courts<a id='r446' /><a href='#f446' class='c014'><sup>[446]</sup></a> have held that,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>except in cities of the first class, the colored children must
be admitted to the schools along with the white children.
The Superintendent of Public Schools of Kansas,<a id='r447' /><a href='#f447' class='c014'><sup>[447]</sup></a> in
August, 1906, said: “There is a movement in Kansas
looking toward the segregation of the races in the public
schools, where the per cent. of colored population will warrant
the separation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A law<a id='r448' /><a href='#f448' class='c014'><sup>[448]</sup></a> of Nevada of 1865 excluded Negroes, Mongolians,
and Indians from the public schools, and prescribed
as a punishment to the school opening its doors to
all races a withdrawal of its share of the public school fund.
The school officials might, however, if they deemed it advisable,
establish a separate school for the children of
Negroes, Mongolians, and Indians, to be supported out of
the public school fund. In 1872 it was held<a id='r449' /><a href='#f449' class='c014'><sup>[449]</sup></a> that a
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mandamus</span></i> would lie compelling trustees to admit colored
persons to the public schools where separate schools were
not provided for such persons. No subsequent reference to
the subject appears in the statutes or reports, so it may
be assumed that separate schools no longer exist in
Nevada.</p>

<p class='c007'>A statute<a id='r450' /><a href='#f450' class='c014'><sup>[450]</sup></a> of New Jersey of 1881 made it unlawful
to exclude anyone from the public school on account of
“religion, nationality, or color.” The town of Burlington
had four public schools, one of which had been set apart
for Negroes. A Negro petitioned for a writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mandamus</span></i>
to compel the trustees to admit his children to the white
schools, and the court<a id='r451' /><a href='#f451' class='c014'><sup>[451]</sup></a> issued the writ. About four
years ago the public schools of East Orange, New Jersey,
adopted the policy of teaching the Negro pupils in separate
classes; but it was soon abandoned because, the school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>authorities said, “it seemed like going back to old
ideas.”<a id='r452' /><a href='#f452' class='c014'><sup>[452]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The city of Buffalo, New York, under a provision of
its charter, established separate schools for Negroes, and
this action was upheld by the court<a id='r453' /><a href='#f453' class='c014'><sup>[453]</sup></a> on the ground that
the right to attend common schools is a legislative grant
and not a constitutional guarantee. The city of Albany
also set apart one school for Negroes, and this was held<a id='r454' /><a href='#f454' class='c014'><sup>[454]</sup></a>
constitutional in 1872. And in 1883, the Supreme Court<a id='r455' /><a href='#f455' class='c014'><sup>[455]</sup></a>
of that State held that, if separate schools are provided
for colored children, they may be excluded from the white
schools. In 1899, the same was held<a id='r456' /><a href='#f456' class='c014'><sup>[456]</sup></a> for the Borough
of Queens. These decisions were under the law of 1864,<a id='r457' /><a href='#f457' class='c014'><sup>[457]</sup></a>
reënacted in 1894,<a id='r458' /><a href='#f458' class='c014'><sup>[458]</sup></a> which gave power to the school authorities
of cities and incorporated villages, when they
deemed it expedient, to establish separate schools. But
this law was repealed in 1900,<a id='r459' /><a href='#f459' class='c014'><sup>[459]</sup></a> and the present law reads:
“No person shall be refused admission to or be excluded
from any public school in the State of New York on account
of race or color.”</p>

<p class='c007'>An Ohio statute<a id='r460' /><a href='#f460' class='c014'><sup>[460]</sup></a> of 1878 gave the boards of education
discretionary power to establish separate schools for
Negroes. This law was repealed in 1887,<a id='r461' /><a href='#f461' class='c014'><sup>[461]</sup></a> and thereafter
all public schools were open to colored children.<a id='r462' /><a href='#f462' class='c014'><sup>[462]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In 1869, persons of color were not admitted to the subdistrict
schools of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania,<a id='r463' /><a href='#f463' class='c014'><sup>[463]</sup></a> but this law
was repealed in 1872.<a id='r464' /><a href='#f464' class='c014'><sup>[464]</sup></a> An earlier statute of 1854 had
provided for separate schools for Negroes where there were
more than twenty in the district. The school directors of
Wilkesbarre had united two districts, each having less
than twenty colored children, and put up a school building
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>for Negroes; but the court<a id='r465' /><a href='#f465' class='c014'><sup>[465]</sup></a> held that this was in violation
of the law of 1854. This law was repealed in 1881,<a id='r466' /><a href='#f466' class='c014'><sup>[466]</sup></a>
and it was thereafter unlawful to make any distinction
whatever on account of race or color. The next year, it
was held<a id='r467' /><a href='#f467' class='c014'><sup>[467]</sup></a> that the school directors could not keep open
schools for Negroes exclusively.</p>

<p class='c007'>A West Virginia law<a id='r468' /><a href='#f468' class='c014'><sup>[468]</sup></a> of 1865 required the boards
of education to establish separate schools for Negroes
where there were more than thirty children of that race
in the district. But if the average daily attendance was
less than fifteen for a month, the school should be discontinued
for any period not exceeding six months. If there
were less than thirty children in the district or the attendance
was less than fifteen, the money should be reserved
and used for colored education as the board thought best.
A statute<a id='r469' /><a href='#f469' class='c014'><sup>[469]</sup></a> of 1871 and the Constitution<a id='r470' /><a href='#f470' class='c014'><sup>[470]</sup></a> of 1872 provided
that white and colored persons should not be taught
together. A separate school for Negroes must be established
when the number in the district exceeds twenty-five.
If less, the trustees of two or more districts may establish
a joint school. The Supreme Court<a id='r471' /><a href='#f471' class='c014'><sup>[471]</sup></a> of that State
has held that the constitutional provision requiring separate
schools does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment,
but that the terms of the schools of both races must be of
the same length. Thus, West Virginia is as strict as Virginia
or any Southern State in separating the races in
schools.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wyoming has the following statute<a id='r472' /><a href='#f472' class='c014'><sup>[472]</sup></a>: “When there
are fifteen or more colored children within any school
district, the board of directors thereof, with the approval
of the county superintendent of schools, may provide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>a separate school for the instruction of such colored
children.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The statutes<a id='r473' /><a href='#f473' class='c014'><sup>[473]</sup></a> of Arizona, until 1909, declared that
no child should be refused admission to any public school
on account of race or color. Last year, however, the school
law of that Territory was amended<a id='r474' /><a href='#f474' class='c014'><sup>[474]</sup></a> so as to give the
board of trustees of school districts power, when they deem
it advisable, to segregate pupils of the African from pupils
of the white race and to provide all accommodations made
necessary by such segregation, but the power to segregate
shall be exercised only where the number of pupils of the
African race shall exceed eight in any school district. This
amendment was passed over the Governor’s veto by a two-thirds’
vote of the legislature.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Constitutions of Colorado<a id='r475' /><a href='#f475' class='c014'><sup>[475]</sup></a> of 1876 and of
Idaho<a id='r476' /><a href='#f476' class='c014'><sup>[476]</sup></a> of 1889 provide that no distinction or classification
of pupils shall be made on account of race or color,
and the judicial decisions of those States do not show any
attempts by the school boards to draw color lines.</p>

<p class='c007'>Separate schools were abolished by law in Massachusetts
in 1857.<a id='r477' /><a href='#f477' class='c014'><sup>[477]</sup></a> The present statute<a id='r478' /><a href='#f478' class='c014'><sup>[478]</sup></a> declares that no

or town on account of race or color. In practice, the matter
is not entirely at rest in Massachusetts.</p>

<p class='c007'>The law<a id='r479' /><a href='#f479' class='c014'><sup>[479]</sup></a> of Michigan prohibits the segregation of
the races in schools. Because of objections made by white
students, two Negroes,<a id='r480' /><a href='#f480' class='c014'><sup>[480]</sup></a> in 1908, were refused admission
to the Grand Rapids, Michigan, Medical College, a private
institution. The Negroes appealed to the State circuit
court, which issued a writ of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mandamus</span></i> compelling the
school to admit them. When this was granted and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>were accordingly admitted, thirty-four members of the
junior class of the school “struck,” and the authorities suspended
the class for a time. The Supreme Court<a id='r481' /><a href='#f481' class='c014'><sup>[481]</sup></a> of
Michigan later reversed the order granting the writ of
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">mandamus</span></i>, saying that a private institution of learning,
though incorporated, has a right to say whom it will receive.</p>

<p class='c007'>A statute<a id='r482' /><a href='#f482' class='c014'><sup>[482]</sup></a> of Minnesota declares that a district shall
not classify its pupils with reference to race or color, nor
separate them into different schools or departments upon
such grounds. The punishment for violation of this law
by a district is a forfeiture of its share of the public school
fund so long as the classification or separation continues.
The Territory of New Mexico<a id='r483' /><a href='#f483' class='c014'><sup>[483]</sup></a> makes it a misdemeanor
for a teacher or school director to exclude any child on
account of race or nationality, under penalty of a fine from
fifty dollars to one hundred dollars and three months imprisonment,
and being forever barred from teaching school
or holding any office of profit or honor in the Territory.</p>

<p class='c006'>The separation of the races in public schools is required
by the Constitutions of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.
Complete separation is required by statute in all
of the above-named States and, besides those, also in Arkansas,
Maryland, and Delaware. A discretionary power
is given to the school boards to establish separate schools
in Arizona; in Indiana; in California, as to schools for
Indians, Chinese, and Mongolians; in Kansas, in cities of
over 150,000 inhabitants; and in Wyoming, in districts
having fifteen or more colored pupils. The following
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>States that once had separate schools now prohibit them:
Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York,
Ohio, and Pennsylvania. In addition to these, separate
schools are not allowed in Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Michigan,
Minnesota, New Mexico, and Rhode Island. There
are other States which have never seen fit to make any
mention one way or the other of race distinctions in
schools, either in statutes or court reports; so one is warranted
in inferring that the schools are open to all. They
are Connecticut, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, North
Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin,
and Washington.</p>

<p class='c007'>As has already been said, public education is distinctly
a State function. The Federal government, in the main,
has not undertaken to have anything to do with it, but
Congress, by its exclusive jurisdiction, has supreme control
over the public schools of the District of Columbia, and
the provisions that it has made there for the separation of
the races show in an interesting way the attitude of the
national government upon the subject. A statute<a id='r484' /><a href='#f484' class='c014'><sup>[484]</sup></a> of
1864 reads: “That any white resident of said county shall
be privileged to place his or her child or ward at any one
of the schools provided for the education of white children
in said county he or she may think proper to select, with
the consent of the trustees of both districts; and any colored
resident shall have the same rights with respect to
colored schools.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That it shall be the duty of said commissioners to
provide suitable and convenient houses or rooms for holding
schools for colored children....” The commissioner
might impose a tax of fifty cents <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per capita</span></i> upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>the patrons of the school to aid in its support, but no child
should be excluded because its parents or guardians could
not pay the tax. The school fund was to be divided in
proportion to the number of school children, regardless of
race.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1890 an increase of the Federal appropriation<a id='r485' /><a href='#f485' class='c014'><sup>[485]</sup></a> to
schools was accompanied with the following proviso:
“That no money shall be paid out under this act to any
State or Territory for the support or maintenance of a
college where a distinction of race or color is made on the
admission of students, but the establishment and maintenance
of such colleges separately for white and colored
students shall be held to be a compliance with the provisions
of the act, if the funds received in such State or
territory be equitably divided as hereinafter set forth.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SEPARATION IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS</h3>

<p class='c012'>Thus far, except in the matter of Berea College, the
separation of the races in private schools only has been
considered. Legislation as to private schools is comparatively
meagre. A statute<a id='r486' /><a href='#f486' class='c014'><sup>[486]</sup></a> of Florida of 1895 makes it
a penal offence to conduct a school of any grade—public,
private, or parochial—wherein white persons and Negroes
are instructed or boarded within the same building, or
taught in the same class, or at the same time by the same
teacher. The punishment for violating the law by patronizing
or teaching in such a school is a fine of from
one hundred and fifty to five hundred dollars, or imprisonment
from three to six months. A statute<a id='r487' /><a href='#f487' class='c014'><sup>[487]</sup></a> of
Tennessee of 1901 makes it lawful for any school, academy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>or other place of learning to receive both white and
colored pupils at the same time. It is unlawful for any
teacher to allow them to attend the same school or to teach
them together or to allow them to be taught together, under
a penalty of fifty dollars for each offence and imprisonment
from thirty days to six months. The most recent statute
on the subject of private schools is that of Oklahoma in
1908. It is plainly modeled after the Kentucky law of
1904. Under the Oklahoma statute,<a id='r488' /><a href='#f488' class='c014'><sup>[488]</sup></a> it is unlawful for a
person, corporation, or association of persons to maintain
or operate any college, school, or institution where persons
of the white and colored races are both received as pupils
for instruction. The person, corporation, or association
that operates a school in violation of the statute is guilty
of a misdemeanor, and may be fined not less than one
hundred nor more than five hundred dollars. Each day
such a school is kept open is a separate offence. One who
teaches in such a school is guilty of a misdemeanor and
may be fined from ten to fifty dollars for each day. One
who goes to such a school as a pupil may be fined from five
to twenty dollars for each day. It is not unlawful, however,
for a private school to maintain a separate and distinct
branch thereof “in a different locality.” The Kentucky
statute, it will be remembered, required the separate
branch to be, at least, twenty-five miles from the main
school. The Oklahoma legislature declared that it was
necessary “for the immediate preservation of the public
peace, health, and safety” that this act take effect
at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>Florida, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Tennessee are the
only States that expressly prohibit the teaching of white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>and colored persons in the same private school. Other
States—as Georgia and Texas—declare that, if a school
admits both races, it shall have none of the public school
fund, saying, by implication, that one may operate a school
for both races if he will give up his claim to State aid.
On the other hand, Minnesota has enacted a statute to the
effect that, if a school refuses to admit pupils of both races,
it shall have none of the public school fund, thus saying,
by implication, that it is not unlawful to conduct a private
school exclusively for one race. The recent decision of the
Supreme Court of Michigan to the effect that a private
school may exclude Negroes even though the law of the
State requires public schools to be open to all, regardless
of race or color, has been considered.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>EQUALITY OF ACCOMMODATIONS</h3>

<p class='c012'>In general, the “accommodations, advantages, and facilities”
of schools for Negroes are to be equal to those
for white children, but the requirement has, in many cases,
been loosely construed. It has been held in Missouri<a id='r489' /><a href='#f489' class='c014'><sup>[489]</sup></a>
and Ohio,<a id='r490' /><a href='#f490' class='c014'><sup>[490]</sup></a> for instance, that it is not an unjust discrimination
for the colored children to have to walk
farther to school than the white children. The Supreme
Court<a id='r491' /><a href='#f491' class='c014'><sup>[491]</sup></a> of Kansas in 1903 decided that uniformity of
schools for white and colored children did not require
equality of buildings. The court said: “True, for the accommodation
of a numerous white population a much
larger and more imposing school building is provided than
that set apart for the few colored children in the district.
This, however, is but an incidental matter, and necessarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>unavoidable in the administration of any extended school
system. School-houses cannot be identical in every respect;
but parents cannot, on this account, dictate the one their
children shall attend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The County Board of Education of Richmond County,
Georgia, in 1880, established a high school for Negroes,
but in 1897 it was discontinued for economic reasons, because
the money to educate fifty or sixty Negroes in the
high school would give the rudiments of education to two
hundred of the four hundred young Negroes in the county
who were crowded out. It was understood that the school
would be re-opened as soon as economic considerations permitted.
A Negro brought suit against the board for discrimination
against his race in that the white high school
to which the Board made contributions had not been closed
also. The Supreme Court of that State held<a id='r492' /><a href='#f492' class='c014'><sup>[492]</sup></a> that the
Board had the right to establish or discontinue high schools
when the interests and convenience of the people require it.
There were more white children of the high-school grade
than colored; therefore, the court argued, the Board was
justified in continuing the white high school. The case was
appealed to the Supreme Court<a id='r493' /><a href='#f493' class='c014'><sup>[493]</sup></a> of the United States,
which affirmed the decision of the State court. Mr. Justice
Harlan, delivering the opinion of the court, said:
“... while all admit that the benefits and burdens of
public taxation must be shared by the citizens without discrimination
against any class on account of their race,
the education of the people in the schools maintained by
State taxation is a matter belonging to the respective
States, and any interference on the part of the Federal
authority with the management of such schools cannot be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>justified except in the case of clear and unmistakable disregard
of rights secured by the supreme law of the land.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In general, where separate schools are required, it is
said that they must be equal for both races; but it has
been held that it is not an unjust discrimination to build
more imposing school-houses for the many white children
than for the few colored children; to require the children
of one race to walk farther to school than the other, or to
maintain high schools for one race without doing so for the
other. Only a very few States have escaped altogether the
question of the separation of the races in schools. Even
where the State statutes have declared point-blank by
statute that there shall be no distinction on account of race
or color, the suits that have arisen in those States show
that the school boards have tried to evade the law.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>DIVISION OF PUBLIC SCHOOL FUND</h3>

<p class='c012'>It is commonly believed that the Negro has had and
is now getting much more than his share of the public
school fund. It is said that the Negro is getting nearly
half the money, while he is paying only a very small percentage
of the taxes. Thus, the following is the estimate
of Mr. J. Y. Joyner, Superintendent of Public Instruction
of North Carolina: “Upon the most liberal estimate, it
seems that in 1908 the Negroes received for the maintenance
of their public schools in North Carolina about twice
as much as they paid directly or indirectly for this purpose.
I think that this is about in accordance with the
experience and observation of those familiar with the administration
of the public schools in North Carolina. My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>own opinion is that the white people pay, directly or indirectly,
for the education of the Negro more rather than
less than one dollar for every dollar that the Negro pays,
directly or indirectly for that purpose.” Mr. J. D. Eggleston,
Jr., Superintendent of Public Instruction of Virginia,
estimates that the public school fund for Negroes in
that State is $500,000, of which the Negro pays $87,000,
or less than one-fifth.<a id='r494' /><a href='#f494' class='c014'><sup>[494]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There have been fitful efforts from time to time to divide
the public school fund in proportion to the amount
of taxes paid by each race. The most recent and thorough-going
effort<a id='r495' /><a href='#f495' class='c014'><sup>[495]</sup></a> to have the school fund so apportioned was
made by Ex-Governor James K. Vardaman, of Mississippi.
But his effort, like that of those before him, came to
naught. The white taxpayers of the South have not shown
any very evident desire to withdraw their financial aid
from the colored public schools. But there has been
enough legislation on different phases of the question
of the apportionment of the school money to deserve
attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Alabama,<a id='r496' /><a href='#f496' class='c014'><sup>[496]</sup></a> in 1896, all poll tax money paid by
colored persons went to the support of colored schools, and
all that paid by white persons, to the support of white
schools. The present Code apparently does not require
this separation of taxes; but in the provisions for special
tax districts<a id='r497' /><a href='#f497' class='c014'><sup>[497]</sup></a> for school purposes, the law provides that
the amount paid by whites and blacks shall be kept separate,
presumably meaning that the funds arising from
special taxation shall be apportioned according to the
amount paid by each race. Though Delaware usually
makes an annual appropriation for colored schools, nevertheless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>in 1875,<a id='r498' /><a href='#f498' class='c014'><sup>[498]</sup></a> and again in 1887,<a id='r499' /><a href='#f499' class='c014'><sup>[499]</sup></a> it provided for a
tax of thirty cents on the hundred dollars upon the
property of colored persons for the maintenance of colored
schools.</p>

<p class='c007'>The legislation of Kentucky with regard to the raising
and apportionment of its public school fund has been
unique. In 1866,<a id='r500' /><a href='#f500' class='c014'><sup>[500]</sup></a> all capitation taxes paid by Negroes
and, in addition, a tax of two dollars <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">per capita</span></i> upon
Negroes went toward the support of their paupers and
the education of their children. In 1869,<a id='r501' /><a href='#f501' class='c014'><sup>[501]</sup></a> a vote was
taken upon the propriety of levying a tax of fifteen
cents on the hundred dollars upon the property of white
persons for the support of white schools exclusively. In
1873,<a id='r502' /><a href='#f502' class='c014'><sup>[502]</sup></a> a property tax of twenty cents on the hundred
dollars and a poll tax of one dollar were levied upon
Negroes of McCracken County for the maintenance of their
schools. The same method of taxation was adopted for
Bowling Green<a id='r503' /><a href='#f503' class='c014'><sup>[503]</sup></a> and Catlettsburg<a id='r504' /><a href='#f504' class='c014'><sup>[504]</sup></a> and Garrard
County.<a id='r505' /><a href='#f505' class='c014'><sup>[505]</sup></a> As to the last-mentioned place, there was a
provision that in the county white and colored school-houses
must be not less than a half mile apart, and in
towns not less than eight hundred feet. In Bracken
County<a id='r506' /><a href='#f506' class='c014'><sup>[506]</sup></a> a special tax of twenty-five cents on the hundred
dollars was levied upon the property of whites for
their schools, not applying to Negroes at all. The constitutionality<a id='r507' /><a href='#f507' class='c014'><sup>[507]</sup></a>
of this law was upheld by the Supreme
Court of Kentucky on the ground that whatever benefits
the Negro is entitled to under the school system he receives
as a citizen of Kentucky, not as a citizen of the United
States.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1874, the same State<a id='r508' /><a href='#f508' class='c014'><sup>[508]</sup></a> provided for a uniform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>system of schools for Negroes. The sources of the revenue
for the schools were (1) a tax of twenty cents on the
hundred dollars upon the property of Negroes, (2) their
poll taxes, (3) their dog taxes, (4) taxes on deeds, suits
and licenses collected from colored persons, (5) fines, penalties,
and forfeitures collected from them, (6) sums received
from Congress, provided the apportionment to each
colored child did not exceed that to each white child, and
(7) gifts, donations, and grants. Colored school-houses
must not be erected within one mile of a white school-house
in the country and six hundred feet in towns. In
1880, Owensboro<a id='r509' /><a href='#f509' class='c014'><sup>[509]</sup></a> was authorized to levy a tax of thirty
cents on the hundred dollars and two dollars on the
poll upon Negroes for colored schools, provided the Negroes
voted to tax themselves for this purpose. This law
was held<a id='r510' /><a href='#f510' class='c014'><sup>[510]</sup></a> unconstitutional by the Federal district court
in 1883, the court saying: “If taxes can be distributed
according to color or race classification, no good reason
why a division might not be made according to the amount
paid by each taxpayer, and thus limit the benefits and distribute
the protection of the laws by a classification based
upon the wealth of the taxpayer. Such distribution would
entirely ignore the spirit of our republican institutions and
would not be the equal protection of the laws as understood
by the people of the State at the time of the adoption
of this (the Fourteenth) amendment.” The laws of Kentucky
of 1874 were held<a id='r511' /><a href='#f511' class='c014'><sup>[511]</sup></a> unconstitutional in 1885. In
1886, Elkton<a id='r512' /><a href='#f512' class='c014'><sup>[512]</sup></a> was authorized to levy a tax of two dollars
on the poll and ninety-five cents on the hundred
dollars upon Negroes if they voted thus to tax themselves.
Apparently the last act of legislation<a id='r513' /><a href='#f513' class='c014'><sup>[513]</sup></a> with regard to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>school fund in Kentucky was in 1904, when provision was
made for a system of graded schools in cities of the fourth
class, but the property or polls of one race were not to be
taxed for the support of the schools of the other. A recent
Kentucky case has held<a id='r514' /><a href='#f514' class='c014'><sup>[514]</sup></a> that, after the regular public
school fund of the State has been apportioned among the
districts in proportion to the number of children regardless
of race, then it is not improper for a district to supplement
that fund by a tax on the property of white persons
for the further support of white schools and upon the
property of Negroes for their schools. Thus, it appears
that Kentucky is honeycombed with the special tax districts
wherein each race supports its own schools. Whether
this arrangement is constitutional or not is still in doubt,
as no square decision on the point has yet been rendered
by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>For some years North Carolina has been exercising the
principle of local, special taxation to supplement the general
public school fund. In several instances, about 1886,
the communities levied the tax only upon the whites for
the benefit of white schools, but this was held<a id='r515' /><a href='#f515' class='c014'><sup>[515]</sup></a> unconstitutional
by the State Supreme Court, and the attempt to
thus distinguish between the races does not appear to have
been made since. The courts of Kentucky and North Carolina
are in conflict, due to the differences in the constitutions
of those States, on the question of special taxation
by each race for its own schools. The local tax districts in
North Carolina have recently been increasing at the rate
of about two a day, but the tax is levied upon colored
persons as well as white, and all the schools share the
benefits.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>The Constitution of Texas<a id='r516' /><a href='#f516' class='c014'><sup>[516]</sup></a> of 1866 provided that
all taxes collected from Negroes should go to maintain
their public schools, and that it should be the duty of the
legislature to encourage schools among these people. This
provision, however, does not appear in the later Constitution
of Texas.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, one sees that, here and there, particularly in Kentucky,
there are precedents for a division of the school
fund in proportion to the taxes paid by each race, but
there has not been any general movement in this direction.
One is justified in concluding that, although the Southern
States stand steadfastly for race separation in both
public and private schools, they do not desire a division of
the public school funds except in proportion to the number
of children of school age. It is true that there have been
some local legislative acts looking in that direction, and a
few sporadic political movements to the same effect; nevertheless,
the fact that the local legislation has not become
general since the Negro has been practically eliminated
from politics and that the political movements have met
with such scanty popular support show that the people are
satisfied with the present arrangement as to the division
of the school fund.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <span class='large'>SEPARATION OF RACES IN PUBLIC CONVEYANCES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There is perhaps no phase of the American race problem
which has been discussed so much within the last decade
as the so-called “Jim Crow” laws, the statutes requiring
separate accommodations for white and colored
passengers in public conveyances. This arises largely from
the fact that these legislative enactments are of general
concern, while the other legal distinctions have directly
affected only certain classes of each race. Laws prohibiting
intermarriage, for instance, concern only those of marriageable
age; suffrage restrictions apply only to males of
voting age; and statutes requiring separate schools affect
immediately only children and youths; but the laws requiring
white and colored passengers to occupy separate seats,
compartments, or coaches concern every man, woman, and
child, who travels, the country over. They affect not only
those living in the States where the laws are in force, but
the entire traveling public. The white man or the Negro
in Massachusetts may not care anything about the suffrage
restrictions of South Carolina, but, if he travels through
the South, he must experience the requirements of the
“Jim Crow” laws.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>ORIGIN OF “JIM CROW”</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The phrase “Jim Crow” has become so inseparably
affixed to the laws separating the races in public conveyances
that two States, North Carolina and Maryland,
have indexed the laws on that subject under
“J” in some of their annual statutes. The earliest
public use of the phrase appears to have been in
1835, when Thomas D. Rice, the first Negro minstrel,
brought out in Washington a dramatic song and Negro
dance called “Jim Crow.” The late actor, Joseph
Jefferson, when only four years old, appeared in this
dance.<a id='r517' /><a href='#f517' class='c014'><sup>[517]</sup></a> In 1841 “Jim Crow” was first used in Massachusetts
to apply to a railroad car set apart for the use of
Negroes.<a id='r518' /><a href='#f518' class='c014'><sup>[518]</sup></a> The phrase, then, has a somewhat more dignified
origin than is ordinarily attributed to it by those
who have considered it as only an opprobrious comparison
of the color of the Negro with that of the crow.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>DEVELOPMENT OF LEGISLATION PRIOR TO 1875</h3>

<p class='c012'>The first “Jim Crow” laws are those of Florida and
Mississippi in 1865, and Texas in 1866. The laws<a id='r519' /><a href='#f519' class='c014'><sup>[519]</sup></a> of
Florida provided: “That if any Negro, mulatto, or other
person of color shall intrude himself into&nbsp;... any railroad
car or other public vehicle set apart for the exclusive
accommodation of white people, he shall be deemed guilty
of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be sentenced
to stand in pillory for one hour, or be whipped, not exceeding
thirty-nine stripes, or both, at the discretion of the
jury, nor shall it be lawful for any white person to intrude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>himself into any railroad car or other public vehicle set
apart for the exclusive accommodation of persons of color,
under the same penalties.” The law<a id='r520' /><a href='#f520' class='c014'><sup>[520]</sup></a> of Mississippi was
as follows: “That it shall be unlawful for any officer,
station agent, conductor, or employee on any railroad in
this State, to allow any freedman, Negro, or mulatto, to
ride in any first-class passenger cars, set apart, or used
by, and for white persons; and any person offending
against the provisions of this section shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor, and on conviction thereof, before
the circuit court of the county in which said offence
was committed, shall be fined not less than fifty dollars,
nor more than five hundred dollars; and shall be imprisoned
in the county jail until such fine and costs of prosecution
are paid: Provided, that this section of this act
shall not apply in the case of Negroes or mulattoes, traveling
with their mistresses, in the capacity of nurses.”
Texas<a id='r521' /><a href='#f521' class='c014'><sup>[521]</sup></a> simply provided that every railroad company
should be required to attach to each passenger train
run by it one car for the special accommodation of
freedmen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other Southern States, perhaps, would have undertaken
similar legislation, had the legislatures been left
unfettered; but under the Reconstruction régime, a number
of the States even passed laws prohibiting discrimination
against Negroes in public conveyances. In 1870, the
Georgia legislature<a id='r522' /><a href='#f522' class='c014'><sup>[522]</sup></a> enacted a statute requiring the railroads
in the State to furnish equal accommodations to
all, without regard to race, color, or previous condition,
when a greater amount of fare was exacted than had been
exacted before January 1, 1861, which had been at that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>time half-fare for persons of color. Texas,<a id='r523' /><a href='#f523' class='c014'><sup>[523]</sup></a> in 1871, repealed
the law of 1866 and prohibited public carriers
“from making any distinctions in the carrying of passengers”
on account of race, color, or previous condition,
making the violation of the law a misdemeanor punishable
by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than five
hundred dollars, or imprisonment for not less than thirty
or more than ninety days, or both. In 1873, Louisiana<a id='r524' /><a href='#f524' class='c014'><sup>[524]</sup></a>
prohibited common carriers from making any discrimination
against any citizen of the State or of the United
States on account of race or color, and went further still
by prohibiting common carriers from other States from
making such discriminations while in the State. Out of
this latter provision arose the great case of Hall v. DeCuir,
which will be discussed later. In 1874, Arkansas<a id='r525' /><a href='#f525' class='c014'><sup>[525]</sup></a>
prohibited any public carrier from making any rules for
the government or control of his business which should
not affect all persons alike, without regard to race or
color.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the meantime, some of the States outside the South
were taking steps to adjust the privileges of persons of
color. In 1866, Massachusetts<a id='r526' /><a href='#f526' class='c014'><sup>[526]</sup></a> made it unlawful’“to
exclude persons from or restrict them in&nbsp;... any public
conveyance&nbsp;... except for good cause.” The following
year, Pennsylvania<a id='r527' /><a href='#f527' class='c014'><sup>[527]</sup></a> enacted a statute prohibiting railroads
from excluding persons from their cars or requiring
them to ride in different parts of the cars on account of
color or race, also prohibiting the conductor or other agent
of the railroad from throwing the car off the track to
prevent such persons from riding. This law was passed
just a few days before the famous case of West Chester
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>and Philadelphia Railway Company v. Mills was decided,
which case will also be discussed later.</p>

<p class='c007'>A statute of Delaware<a id='r528' /><a href='#f528' class='c014'><sup>[528]</sup></a> of 1875, as has been seen, declared
that the carriers of passengers might make such
arrangements in their business as would, if necessary, assign
a particular place in their cars, carriages, or boats to
such of their customers as they might choose to place there,
and whose presence elsewhere would be offensive to the
major part of the traveling public, where their business
was conducted; but the accommodations must be equal
for all if the same price for carriage was required from all.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>LEGISLATION BETWEEN 1865 AND 1881</h3>

<p class='c012'>Before considering the “Jim Crow” laws of the
Southern States, it will be instructive to look into some
of the court decisions between 1865 and 1881, the latter
being the date of adoption of the first “Jim Crow” law
of the second period, to see what steps the railroad, street
car, and steamboat companies had taken to separate the
races, in the absence of State legislation upon the subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1865, a colored woman ejected from a street car in
Philadelphia<a id='r529' /><a href='#f529' class='c014'><sup>[529]</sup></a> brought action against the conductor, who
pleaded that there was a rule established by the road superintendent
that Negroes should be excluded from the
cars. The court held that the conductor had no right to
eject a passenger on account of race or color, and that a
regulation of the company would not be a defence to the
action.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just a few days after the Pennsylvania legislature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>passed the act prohibiting discriminations against persons
of color in public conveyances, to which reference has been
made, the Supreme Court of the State ruled<a id='r530' /><a href='#f530' class='c014'><sup>[530]</sup></a> that it was
not an unreasonable regulation of the railroad company to
separate the passengers so as to promote personal comfort
and convenience. This is interesting because it is the
earliest case found supporting the legality of the separation
of races in public conveyances. Since the case arose
before the Civil Rights Bill of the Commonwealth was
adopted, it does not purport to rule upon the constitutionality
of that act.</p>

<p class='c007'>In San Francisco,<a id='r531' /><a href='#f531' class='c014'><sup>[531]</sup></a> in 1868, a street car conductor refused
to stop for a colored woman, saying, “We don’t take
colored people in the cars,” whereupon she brought an
action against the company and was awarded damages by
the lower court. Here there is an implication that the
railroad company had a regulation excluding persons of
color from street cars.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1870, the Chicago and Northwestern Railway Company<a id='r532' /><a href='#f532' class='c014'><sup>[532]</sup></a>
refused to admit a colored woman to the car set
apart for ladies and gentlemen accompanying them.
Whereupon she brought an action and recovered two hundred
dollars damages. It does not appear from the case
that the railroad had set apart any car or part of a car
for the exclusive accommodation of colored persons.</p>

<p class='c007'>A steamboat company in Iowa, in 1873, had a regulation
that colored passengers should not eat at the regular
tables, but at a table on the “guards” of the boat.
The Supreme Court of that State held<a id='r533' /><a href='#f533' class='c014'><sup>[533]</sup></a> that this rule
was unreasonable and, therefore, illegal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first case to reach the Supreme Court of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>United States involving the separation of white and colored
passengers on cars was one brought against the Washington,
Alexandria, and Georgetown Railroad Company, in
1873. This road was chartered by Congress in 1863 with
the provision that no person should be excluded from the
cars on account of color. A Negro woman, with an ordinary
first-class ticket, was made to ride in a separate coach
precisely like that used by the white passengers. The
court ruled<a id='r534' /><a href='#f534' class='c014'><sup>[534]</sup></a> that the Act of 1863 meant that persons of
color should travel in the same cars as white persons without
any distinction being made; that, therefore, the law
was not satisfied by the company’s providing cars assigned
exclusively to persons of color, though they were as good
as those assigned to white passengers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1869, the Louisiana<a id='r535' /><a href='#f535' class='c014'><sup>[535]</sup></a> legislature passed a law prohibiting
railroad, street car, and steamboat companies
from making any discrimination on account of race or
color. In the often-cited case of Hall v. DeCuir,<a id='r536' /><a href='#f536' class='c014'><sup>[536]</sup></a> a test
case arising under this act in 1875, the Supreme Court
ruled that the Louisiana act was unconstitutional because
it was an interference with interstate commerce. Chief
Justice Waite, in delivering the opinion of the court, said:
“If each State was at liberty to regulate the conduct of
carriers while within its jurisdiction, the confusion likely
to follow could not but be productive of great inconvenience
and unnecessary hardship.” This case has stood as a
warning to the Southern States that they must be careful
to mention in their “Jim Crow” laws that they apply
only to intrastate passengers. But, as will be seen later,
though this case has not been overruled, it has been refined
upon.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>In a case<a id='r537' /><a href='#f537' class='c014'><sup>[537]</sup></a> arising in the Federal District Court of
Texas in 1877, it was held that for a railroad employee to
deny to a passenger the right to ride in the only car appropriated
for the use of ladies, because she was a colored
woman, was a violation of the Civil Rights Bill. But the
judge, in charging the jury at the trial, said that, if there
were two cars equally fit and appropriate, then the white
and colored passengers might be separated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above are only a few of the many cases which
arose between 1865 and 1881, involving the separation of
white and colored passengers; they are cited to show that,
in the absence of legislative authority, many of the public
conveyance companies had regulations of their own separating
the races. The “Jim Crow” laws, in other words,
coming later, did scarcely more than to legalize an existing
and widespread custom.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SEPARATION OF PASSENGERS ON STEAMBOATS</h3>

<p class='c012'>As already suggested, the “Jim Crow” laws apply to
three classes of vehicles, namely: steamboats, railroad cars,
and street cars. There is comparatively little legislation
about white and colored passengers on steamboats. North
Carolina<a id='r538' /><a href='#f538' class='c014'><sup>[538]</sup></a> is the only State to include steamboats in the
regular “Jim Crow” law. It requires all steamboat companies
engaged as common carriers in the transportation
of passengers for hire to provide separate but equal accommodations
for the white and colored races of all steamboats
carrying passengers. The violation of this law is punishable
by a fine of one hundred dollars; each day is considered
a separate offence.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>On February 9, 1900, the Virginia<a id='r539' /><a href='#f539' class='c014'><sup>[539]</sup></a> legislature enacted
a statute requiring the separation of white and colored
passengers on all steamboats carrying passengers and
plying in the waters within the jurisdiction of the State in
the sitting, sleeping, and eating apartments, so far as the
“construction of the boat and due consideration for comfort
of passengers” would permit. There must be no difference
in the quality of accommodations. The law makes
an exception of nurses and other attendants traveling with
their employers, and officers in charge of prisoners. For
disobeying the law, the boat officer is guilty of a misdemeanor
punishable by a fine of not less than twenty-five
dollars nor more than one hundred dollars. Any passenger
wilfully disobeying the law is guilty of a misdemeanor
punishable by a fine of not less than five dollars nor more
than fifty dollars or by imprisonment for not less than
thirty days, or both. The boat officer may eject an offending
passenger at any landing place, and neither he nor
the steamboat company will be liable. In 1901, the above
law<a id='r540' /><a href='#f540' class='c014'><sup>[540]</sup></a> was made more stringent by omitting the provision
about the construction of the boat and consideration for
the comfort of the passengers, quoted above. In 1904,
South Carolina<a id='r541' /><a href='#f541' class='c014'><sup>[541]</sup></a> required all ferries to have separate
cabins for white and colored passengers.</p>

<p class='c007'>The above legislation seems to be the only legislation
as to steamboats up to the present; but it does not measure
the separation of the races on steamboats, inasmuch
as the companies in the various States have adopted regulations
requiring separate accommodations for the races.
This custom applies to interstate as well as to intrastate
travel. The steamers plying between Boston and the ports
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>of the South, for instance, provide separate dining tables,
separate toilet rooms, and separate smoking rooms for the
white and colored passengers. This regulation of interstate
travel is upheld by two Federal cases, one in Georgia<a id='r542' /><a href='#f542' class='c014'><sup>[542]</sup></a>
in 1879 and the other in Maryland<a id='r543' /><a href='#f543' class='c014'><sup>[543]</sup></a> in 1885, which
held in substance, that, inasmuch as Congress has enacted
no law which forbids interstate common carriers from
separating white and colored passengers so long as the
accommodations are equal, during congressional inaction,
the companies may make their own regulations.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SEPARATION OF PASSENGERS IN RAILROAD CARS</h3>

<p class='c012'>With the exception of the transient “Jim Crow” laws
of Mississippi, Florida, and Texas of 1865–67, the first
State to adopt a comprehensive law separating the white
and colored passengers on railroad cars was Tennessee<a id='r544' /><a href='#f544' class='c014'><sup>[544]</sup></a>
which did so in 1881. The statute of that State stood alone
until 1887, when a series of “Jim Crow” laws were enacted
by the States in the following order: Florida,<a id='r545' /><a href='#f545' class='c014'><sup>[545]</sup></a> 1887;
Mississippi,<a id='r546' /><a href='#f546' class='c014'><sup>[546]</sup></a> 1888; Texas,<a id='r547' /><a href='#f547' class='c014'><sup>[547]</sup></a> 1889; Louisiana,<a id='r548' /><a href='#f548' class='c014'><sup>[548]</sup></a> 1890;
Alabama,<a id='r549' /><a href='#f549' class='c014'><sup>[549]</sup></a> Kentucky,<a id='r550' /><a href='#f550' class='c014'><sup>[550]</sup></a> Arkansas,<a id='r551' /><a href='#f551' class='c014'><sup>[551]</sup></a> and Georgia,<a id='r552' /><a href='#f552' class='c014'><sup>[552]</sup></a> 1891.
For some years thereafter the subject remained untouched
by the legislatures, save an amending statute now and
then; but in 1898–99, the other Southern States began
to fall into line: South Carolina,<a id='r553' /><a href='#f553' class='c014'><sup>[553]</sup></a> 1898; North Carolina,<a id='r554' /><a href='#f554' class='c014'><sup>[554]</sup></a>
1899; Virginia,<a id='r555' /><a href='#f555' class='c014'><sup>[555]</sup></a> 1900; Maryland,<a id='r556' /><a href='#f556' class='c014'><sup>[556]</sup></a> 1904; Oklahoma,<a id='r557' /><a href='#f557' class='c014'><sup>[557]</sup></a>
1907. It appears that Missouri is the only Southern
State which has not separated the races in railroad
cars.</p>

<p class='c007'>The details of the “Jim Crow” laws as to railroads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>are very nearly the same in all the Southern States. They
require white persons, on the one hand, and “Negroes,”
“persons of color,” “persons of African descent,” etc., on
the other, to occupy separate seats, compartments, or
coaches. The legal meaning of the above-mentioned
phrases has already been considered. It is safe to say, as
the Arkansas statute does declare, that, if one has a visible
and distinct admixture of African blood, he must accept
the accommodations furnished colored passengers.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Interstate and Intrastate Travel</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>The first great question that arises is the extent of
application of the laws. The statutes declare that they
apply to all railroads doing business in the State. But
just what does this mean? It has been generally understood
and the principle has been confirmed by judicial decisions<a id='r558' /><a href='#f558' class='c014'><sup>[558]</sup></a>
that States may pass laws separating passengers
going one from one point to another in the same State.
But how about passengers coming from or going to points
outside the State? Suppose, for instance, a colored passenger
were to board a train at Philadelphia for Evansville,
Indiana, and go through Maryland, West Virginia,
and Kentucky. Pennsylvania and West Virginia have no
“Jim Crow” laws; Maryland and Kentucky have. When
the colored passenger reaches the Maryland line, must he
enter a car set apart for colored people? When he reaches
the West Virginia line, may he go back into the coach
with white passengers? When, again, he reaches the Kentucky
line, will he be forced to return to the car set apart
for his race? And, finally, when he comes to Indiana, may
he once more return to the car for white passengers? Or,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>suppose a railroad from Ohio to Indiana has only a few
miles of its track in Kentucky and only two depôts in that
State. Must the railroad furnish separate accommodations
for the white and colored passengers going between
those two points in Kentucky? If these questions had been
asked thirty years ago or at the time of the Hall v. DeCuir
case, there is no doubt that the Federal courts would have
held that it was an unwarranted interference with interstate
commerce or would lead to too much confusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The law of Alabama of 1891 contained the provision
that “this act shall not apply to cases where white or colored
passengers enter this State upon such railroads under
contract for their transportation made in other States
where like laws to this do not prevail.” Since these laws,
however, have become so prevalent throughout the South,
the courts seem to have swung over to the side of public
opinion. In 1889, the Supreme Court of Mississippi
held<a id='r559' /><a href='#f559' class='c014'><sup>[559]</sup></a> that though the “Jim Crow” law of that State
applied only to intrastate travel, it was not an unwarranted
burden upon interstate railroads to require them
to furnish separate accommodations for the races as soon
as they came across the State line.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1894, the “Jim Crow” law of Kentucky was declared
unconstitutional by the Federal Circuit Court<a id='r560' /><a href='#f560' class='c014'><sup>[560]</sup></a> because
the language of the acts was so comprehensive as to
embrace all passengers, whether their passage commenced
or ended within the State or otherwise and thus interfered
with interstate commerce. Four years later, however, the
Court of Appeals<a id='r561' /><a href='#f561' class='c014'><sup>[561]</sup></a> of Kentucky, considering the same
statute, ruled that the law of that State was not in violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment or the “interstate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>commerce clause” of the Federal Constitution, arguing
that, if it did apply to interstate passengers, which was
not conceded, it would be construed to apply only to transportation
within the State. Under this latter ruling apparently
the colored passenger going from West Virginia
to Indiana through Kentucky would have to ride in the
car provided for his race in that State.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same year, 1898, the Supreme Court<a id='r562' /><a href='#f562' class='c014'><sup>[562]</sup></a> of Tennessee
held that it was a proper exercise of the police power
to require even interstate passengers to occupy separate
accommodations while in that State. The last case<a id='r563' /><a href='#f563' class='c014'><sup>[563]</sup></a>
upon this point, decided April 16, 1907, held that a railroad
company may, independently of statute, adopt and
enforce rules requiring colored passengers, although they
are interstate passengers, to occupy separate coaches or
compartments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the matter stands. In the absence of a recent
United States Supreme Court decision upon the point, it
would be unsafe to make a generalization. But it is clear
that there has been, in the point of view of the Federal
judiciary, a reaction from the extreme doctrine of Hall v.
DeCuir. All the lower courts, both State and Federal, are
inclined to make the laws apply to all passengers, both
intrastate and interstate, so long as they are within the
borders of the particular State.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Sleeping Cars</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>In a number of the “Jim Crow” laws there are special
provisions about Pullman cars. Oklahoma and Texas provide
that carriers may haul sleeping or chair cars for
the exclusive use of either race separately, but not jointly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>Georgia goes farthest in legislation on this point. In 1899,
the legislature provided that, in assigning seats and berths
on sleeping cars, white and colored passengers must be
separated; but declared that nothing in the act should be
construed to compel sleeping-car companies to carry persons
of color in sleeping or parlor cars. The act does not
apply to nurses and servants with their employers, who
may enter and ride in the car with their employers. The
conductors are made special policemen to enforce the law,
and the failure or refusal to do so is punishable as a misdemeanor.
The “Jim Crow” laws in Maryland, North
Carolina, and Virginia do not apply to Pullman cars or
to through express trains; nor, in South Carolina, to
through vestibule trains.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Court of Appeals of Texas,<a id='r564' /><a href='#f564' class='c014'><sup>[564]</sup></a> in 1897, held that
a colored passenger in a Pullman car, going from a point
outside of Texas into that State, might be compelled,
upon reaching the Texas line, to enter a Pullman car set
apart for passengers of his own race, provided the accommodations
were equal. This decision is in harmony with
those already considered with reference to day coaches.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Waiting-Rooms</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>Three States, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma, require
separate waiting-rooms at railroad depôts. In Mississippi,
the railroad commission was given power in
1888 to designate separate waiting-rooms, if it deemed
such proper. In most, if not all, of the other Southern
States, separate waiting-rooms are provided by the railroad
companies on their own initiative, and this action on their
part was held constitutional<a id='r565' /><a href='#f565' class='c014'><sup>[565]</sup></a> in South Carolina in 1893.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>The most recent legislation along this line was an act
of South Carolina of February 23, 1906, requiring a separation
of the races in all station restaurants and eating-houses,
imposing a heavy fine for its violation. It is probable
that the necessity or propriety of this law was suggested
by the disturbance which arose at Hamlet, North
Carolina, near the South Carolina line, when the proprietor
of the Seaboard Air Line Railway eating-house at
that place allowed a party of Negroes, one of whom was
Dr. Booker T. Washington, to eat in the main dining
room, while the white guests were fed in a side room.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Trains to which Laws do not Apply</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>There are certain classes of trains to which the “Jim
Crow” laws do not apply. In Maryland, Oklahoma, Texas,
and Virginia, they do not apply to freight trains carrying
passengers in the caboose cars. South Carolina exempts
narrow-gauged roads from the requirements of the
law. North Carolina gives its railroad commissioners
power to exempt branch lines and narrow-gauged roads
if, in their judgment, separation is unnecessary to secure
the comfort of passengers. South Carolina provides that,
where a railroad is under forty miles in length and operates
both a freight and a passenger train daily, the law
applies only to the passenger train. These two States also
except relief trains in case of accident. Whether there
is statutory exemption or not, the railway company cannot
be held responsible for not separating the passengers
in case of an accident.<a id='r566' /><a href='#f566' class='c014'><sup>[566]</sup></a> Oklahoma allows the running of
extra or special trains or cars for the exclusive accommodation
of either race, if the regular trains or cars are operated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>upon regular schedule. Texas provides that the provisions
of its act shall not apply to any excursion train run
strictly as such for the benefit of either race.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Passengers to whom Law does not Apply</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>Certain classes of passengers are exempt from the laws.
There is, for instance, an exemption in favor of nurses
attending the children or sick of the other race in Florida,
Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, North Carolina,
South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia. The Florida provision
is that nothing in the act shall be construed to prevent
female colored nurses having the care of children or
sick persons from riding in cars for white passengers.
North Carolina excepts “Negro servants in attendance
on their employers.” These two qualifications sound innocent
enough, but probably upon a test they would be
declared unconstitutional. It would be considered class
legislation in that <em>colored</em> nurses and <em>Negro</em> servants are
specifically mentioned instead of exempting nurses and
servants in general. In fact, the point has been decided
in the case of street-car provisions with similar wording.</p>

<p class='c007'>Arkansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, Texas,
and Virginia expressly exempt the employees of a railroad
in the discharge of their duty from the requirements
of the “Jim Crow” laws. Where such exemption is not
so made in the statute, it must be taken for granted, for
it would be manifestly unreasonable to prohibit a white
conductor from going into the colored coach to collect
tickets, or a colored porter from going into the coach for
white passengers to regulate the ventilation or for any
other purpose of his employment. It may be noted, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>that in States where these laws apply, the white conductor
usually assists the white passengers in entering
and leaving the cars, while colored porters attend to the
colored passengers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the States provide that the laws do not apply
to officers in charge of prisoners. Arkansas declares that
“officers accompanying prisoners may be assigned to the
coach or room to which said prisoners belong by reason
of race.” Louisiana, on the contrary, exempts prisoners in
the charge of officers from the “Jim Crow” laws. The
South Carolina law exempts lunatics as well. The law of
Kentucky exempts “officers in charge of prisoners.” When,
in a case which arose in Kentucky, a sheriff went to take a
Negro lunatic over the road, the conductor required the
lunatic to stay in the colored coach, and gave the sheriff the
choice of staying with the lunatic or leaving him and riding
in the car for white passengers. The court<a id='r567' /><a href='#f567' class='c014'><sup>[567]</sup></a> upheld the
action of the conductor, ruling that the exemption applied
only to the officers, not to the prisoners. The law has the
same effect as if it said that the officer should ride in the
car set apart for the race of the prisoner or lunatic, because
it is his duty to guard his charge, and, if the prisoner
or lunatic must stay in the car for his race, the officer
must stay there with him. North Carolina, South Carolina,
and Maryland exempt prisoners from the requirements
of the “Jim Crow” laws.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Nature of Accommodations</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>As to the nature of railroad accommodations, all “Jim
Crow” laws provide, in substance, that the accommodations
for white and colored passengers must be equal for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>both races. Florida provides that the coaches for colored
passengers (with first-class tickets) must be equally good
and provided with the same facilities for comfort as those
for white passengers with first-class tickets. Kentucky,
Maryland, and Virginia prohibit any difference in quality,
convenience, or accommodation. Tennessee provides
that the first-class coaches for colored passengers must “be
kept in good repair, and with the same convenience and
subject to the same rules governing other first-class cars,
preventing smoking and obscene language.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no one point upon which the courts are more
in accord than that there is no ground of action so long
as the accommodations are substantially equal.<a id='r568' /><a href='#f568' class='c014'><sup>[568]</sup></a> The
great working principle was enunciated in 1885 in the Circuit
Court<a id='r569' /><a href='#f569' class='c014'><sup>[569]</sup></a> of Tennessee in the doctrine that equality of
accommodation does not mean identity of accommodation.
And, indeed, the railroad company is not liable for
damages even for inequality of accommodation, unless it
is proved that the plaintiff actually sustained damages by
such inequality.<a id='r570' /><a href='#f570' class='c014'><sup>[570]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Means of Separation</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>The actual separation of the races is accomplished by
requiring railroads to furnish on each passenger train
either separate cars or one car divided into separate compartments
by a partition. Each State gives the choice.
In case of the division of the car into compartments, the
partition must, in Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Kentucky, be
made of wood; in Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and
Texas, it must be “substantial”; and in Maryland and
Texas, it must have a door in it. Arkansas requires only a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>partitioned car on roads less than thirty miles long, but
separate cars on longer roads, though a train on any road
may carry one partitioned car.</p>

<p class='c007'>Maryland and North Carolina provide that, in case
the car or compartment for either race becomes filled and
no extra cars can be obtained and the increased number
of passengers could not have been foreseen, the conductor
may assign a portion of the car or compartment for one
race to the passengers of the other race.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Designation of Separation</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>Several States specify a means by which the public
shall be notified of the existence of the “Jim Crow” requirements.
Arkansas requires the law to be posted in
each coach and waiting-room; Louisiana, in each coach
and ticket-office; Texas, in each coach and depôt. In
Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Texas, each coach
or compartment must bear in some conspicuous place appropriate
words, in plain letters, to indicate the race for
which it was set apart.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Punishment for Violating Law</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>Certain liabilities are incurred for the violation of the
“Jim Crow” laws. The three parties concerned are the
passenger, the conductor or manager of the train, and the
railroad company itself. If a passenger refuses to occupy
the coach or compartment to which he, by his race, belongs,
the conductor may refuse to carry him and may
eject him if he is already on the train; and for this neither
the conductor nor the railroad company is liable. In
Georgia and Texas, conductors are given express power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>to enforce the law, and in other States the power is implied.
Some States punish passengers for wilfully riding
in the wrong car by a fine ranging from a minimum
of five dollars in Maryland and Texas to a maximum of
one thousand dollars in Georgia, or imprisonment from
twenty days in Louisiana to six months in Georgia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conductor is liable for two kinds of offences: (1)
for assigning a passenger to a car or compartment to
which he does not by race belong, and (2) for failing to
separate passengers. Most of the States consider the two
violations as one. Only Arkansas and Louisiana prescribe
separate punishments for assigning the passenger to
the wrong car—a fine of twenty-five dollars in Arkansas
and a fine of twenty-five dollars or twenty days’ imprisonment
in Louisiana. The punishment for refusing to enforce
the law is a fine varying from a minimum of five dollars
in Texas to a maximum of one thousand dollars in
Georgia, or, in a few States, imprisonment of varying
length. In Texas, the fines collected are applied to the
common school fund of the State.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fine imposed upon railroad companies for failing
or refusing to furnish separate accommodations, varies
between twenty-five dollars and one thousand dollars for
each offence, and for this purpose each trip that the train
makes is considered a separate offence. If, however, the
railroad company provides the required separate cars or
compartments and the conductor fails to enforce the law
or violates its provisions, it is the conductor, not the company,
who is liable.<a id='r571' /><a href='#f571' class='c014'><sup>[571]</sup></a></p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>
  <h4 class='c011'><em>Separation of Postal Clerks</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A special question has arisen out of the Federal postal
cars on which both white and colored clerks are employed.
At present, they are obliged to sleep in the same cars, and
at the terminals of long runs dormitories are provided for
them, but without any race separation. The post-office department
has said that such regulation is beyond its control.<a id='r572' /><a href='#f572' class='c014'><sup>[572]</sup></a>
Thus the matter stands, with a growing discontent
on the part of the white postal clerks to be so intimately
associated with the colored clerks.</p>

<p class='c006'>The “Jim Crow” laws in the South, so far as the
railroads are concerned, are very nearly complete. Missouri,
as has been said, is the only one of the Southern
States which has not, by express enactment, separated the
races.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SEPARATION OF PASSENGERS IN STREET CARS</h3>

<p class='c012'>The third division of the subject is the separation of
races in street cars. This is a field of much more active
legislation than any of the preceding, in which much has
been done recently and in which much more is likely to
be done.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the thirteen separate coach laws just considered,
six of them—those of Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi,
South Carolina, and Texas—except street railroads
from their application. Georgia and Oklahoma alone
make their laws all inclusive, embracing electric and street
cars as well as railroad coaches. It is safe to assume that
the laws of the other States refer only to railroad coaches.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>
  <h4 class='c011'><em>Present Extent of Separation</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>With the exception of the early law of Georgia<a id='r573' /><a href='#f573' class='c014'><sup>[573]</sup></a> of
1891, the “Jim Crow” street car laws came in with the new
century. So far, eight of the Southern States have passed
general statutes to separate the races on street cars, in the
following order: Georgia,<a href='#f573' class='c014'><sup>[573]</sup></a> 1891; Louisiana,<a id='r574' /><a href='#f574' class='c014'><sup>[574]</sup></a> 1902; Mississippi,<a id='r575' /><a href='#f575' class='c014'><sup>[575]</sup></a>
1904; Tennessee,<a id='r576' /><a href='#f576' class='c014'><sup>[576]</sup></a> and Florida,<a id='r577' /><a href='#f577' class='c014'><sup>[577]</sup></a> 1905; Virginia,<a id='r578' /><a href='#f578' class='c014'><sup>[578]</sup></a>
1906, and North Carolina,<a id='r579' /><a href='#f579' class='c014'><sup>[579]</sup></a> and Oklahoma,<a id='r580' /><a href='#f580' class='c014'><sup>[580]</sup></a>
1907. The statute of Arkansas,<a id='r581' /><a href='#f581' class='c014'><sup>[581]</sup></a> of 1903, might be included
in the above list, but it applies only to cities of the
first class. Some States passed laws of special application
before they made them general. Thus, in 1902, the legislature
of Virginia<a id='r582' /><a href='#f582' class='c014'><sup>[582]</sup></a> separated the white and colored passengers
on street cars going between Alexandria and points
in Fairfax and Alexandria Counties; and in 1901, between
Richmond and Seven Pines. And so Tennessee,<a id='r583' /><a href='#f583' class='c014'><sup>[583]</sup></a> in 1903,
made the regular separate coach law apply to street cars
in counties having 150,000 inhabitants or over, as shown
by the census of 1900 or any subsequent Federal census.
Memphis only came within this law. In 1905, South
Carolina<a id='r584' /><a href='#f584' class='c014'><sup>[584]</sup></a> required the separation of the races on “electric
railways outside of the corporate limits of cities and
towns.” This State has not yet made the law general.</p>

<p class='c007'>The extent of legislation at present is as follows:
Georgia and Oklahoma, by their regular “Jim Crow”
laws, require the white and colored passengers on street
cars to be separated. Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Tennessee,
Virginia, and North Carolina have separated the
races by statutes specially applicable to street cars. Arkansas,
by statute, requires a separation in cities of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>first class; and South Carolina, on suburban lines. Maryland,
South Carolina, Alabama, Texas, Kentucky and
Missouri do not, by statute, require the races to be separated
on street cars in cities. But the absence of legislative
enactments does not mean at all that races are not
actually separated on street cars. In order to find out
the extent of actual separation, the author made inquiry
of the mayors of every city of 10,000 or more inhabitants
in the Southern States and in West Virginia and Kansas.
Some generalizations may be made from the almost complete
number of replies received. It may be assumed that
the races are separated in the above-mentioned States
which have statutes on the subject. It appears that the
white and colored passengers are <em>not</em> separated on the street
cars of any of the cities of Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland,
Missouri, and West Virginia. In the absence of State
laws, either the municipal authorities or the street railway
companies themselves provide for and require separation
in the cities of Alabama and South Carolina. Thus,
though there is no ordinance on the subject in Charleston,
South Carolina, separation is required by the company
itself.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Method of Separation</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>The city ordinances and regulations requiring separation
on street cars are practically the same as the State
statutes on the subject. The ordinances, regulations, and
statutes all require that the accommodations for passengers
of both races shall be equal. The three methods of
separation are (1) separate cars, (2) partitioned cars, and
(3) seats assigned to each race. The only city that unqualifiedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>requires separate cars is Montgomery, Alabama.
The ordinance was passed October 15, 1906, over the
mayor’s veto, he vetoing it because he believed it would be
impracticable. When the law went into effect, November
23, the service was materially reduced because of the
scarcity of cars.<a id='r585' /><a href='#f585' class='c014'><sup>[585]</sup></a> The State laws of Florida, Louisiana,
and Mississippi give the choice of using two or more cars
or partitioned cars. A number of the ordinances require
that the cars be divided either by movable screens or partitions.
They are movable so as to apportion the seating
capacity to the requirements of each race. But in by far
the greatest number of cases, the separation is accomplished
by the conductor assigning white and colored passengers
to different seats. Practically without exception,
the colored passengers are required to be seated from the
rear to the front of the car; the white, from the front to
the rear. On railroad cars, the colored passengers are
almost invariably assigned to the front compartments.
The colored passengers on street cars are seated in the
rear in order—to give the reason as stated by the mayor
of Birmingham, Alabama—to do “away with the disagreeable
odors that would necessarily follow the breezes.” In
the closed cars of that city, however, the colored passengers
are seated in front so as to give the white passengers the
rear for smoking. In other cities, the two rear seats are
reserved for smoking, so the colored passengers begin to
sit on the third seat from the rear. As the car fills, the
races get nearer and nearer to one another. North Carolina
provides that white and colored passengers shall not
occupy contiguous seats on the same bench. Virginia,
likewise, prohibits white and colored passengers from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>sitting side by side on the same bench unless all the other
seats are filled. The conductor has the power to require
passengers to change their seats as often as is needful to
secure actual separation of the races. The laws do not
prohibit the running of special cars exclusively for either
race, provided the regular cars are run.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cars or compartments are to be clearly designated
to show to which race they belong. Several statutes and
ordinances require that the placard “<span class='fss'>WHITE</span>” or “<span class='fss'>COLORED</span>,”
in plain letters, not less than two inches high,
shall be upon each end of the car or compartment, or
upon the sides of the open cars. A recent case<a id='r586' /><a href='#f586' class='c014'><sup>[586]</sup></a> in Mississippi
would seem to hold that the sign must be large
enough to be seen in all parts of the car. The laws of
Mississippi and Louisiana require that the law be posted
in the car; in Virginia, the substance of the law is posted
in the car. In Houston, Texas, the race to which the seat
belongs is posted on the back of the seat. In several cities,
any one tampering with such a sign will be punished by
a heavy fine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The law of North Carolina probably contains a fatal
defect in that it requires separation “as far as practicable.”
Of course, this would allow the conductors or
companies to make numberless exceptions. As a matter of
fact, most of the North Carolina cities had been contemplating
such a separation, and, when the law went into
effect the first of April, 1907, were ready to regard and
enforce it.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Enforcement of Laws</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>In practically all of the cities, the street-car conductors
and motormen are special policemen to enforce the law.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>For the ejectment of a wilfully disobedient passenger, they
incur no penalty either upon themselves or the company.
North Carolina provides that the conductor shall not be
liable if he makes the mistake of assigning a passenger to
the wrong seat. In several of the cities, it is the duty of
the regular police officers to arrest passengers whom they
see riding in the wrong cars. The penalty upon the conductor
for knowingly failing or refusing to enforce the
law varies all the way from a minimum fine of one dollar
in Montgomery, Alabama, to five hundred dollars in Jacksonville,
Florida, or imprisonment from one to ninety
days. The liability of the company is correspondingly
heavy in proportion. Each trip made without providing
for the requirements of the law is expressly declared a
separate offence. In Pensacola, Florida, the fine upon the
company for not furnishing separate accommodations is
fifty dollars a day.</p>

<p class='c007'>When a passenger consciously disobeys the law, he may
be fined; and if he insists upon occupying the wrong seat,
the conductor may eject him from the car. According to
the Virginia law, “in case such passenger ejected shall
have paid his fare upon said car, he shall not be entitled
to any part of said fare.”</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Exemptions</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>The only phase of these “Jim Crow” street-car laws
which has given rise to any serious discussion is the question
of the exemptions from application. Most of the
States and cities simply except nurses of one race in
attendance upon the children or sick of the other race, the
nurse going into the car to which the child or sick person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>belongs. Of course, the street-car employees are excepted,
and Virginia excepts officers in charge of prisoners and
lunatics. But Florida and North Carolina declared that
the law should not apply to <em>colored</em> nurses in attendance
upon <em>white</em> children or <em>white</em> sick people; and Augusta,
Georgia, has the same in its ordinance. The constitutionality
of the Florida law was tested five years ago in the
Supreme Court<a id='r587' /><a href='#f587' class='c014'><sup>[587]</sup></a> of that State, and was declared to violate
the Fourteenth Amendment, the court, in its opinion,
saying: “It gives to the Caucasian mistress the right to
have her child attended in the Caucasian department of
the car by its African nurse, and withholds from the African
mistress the equal right to have her child attended in
the African department by its Caucasian nurse.” This is
the same discrimination as to the invalid adult Caucasian
attended by a colored nurse. As soon as the Florida State
law was declared unconstitutional, the cities passed ordinances
making the provision apply to nurses of either
race. The North Carolina law was never tested, for it
was amended before a test case reached the courts. The
North Carolina legislature<a id='r588' /><a href='#f588' class='c014'><sup>[588]</sup></a> of 1909 obviated all possible
difficulty by amending its law to the effect that the nurses
of the children or sick or infirm of one race might ride
in the car set apart for the race of the infant or sick or
infirm person so attended.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X<br /> <span class='large'>NEGRO IN COURT ROOM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Negro goes into a court room in one or more of
six capacities, namely: as spectator, witness, juror, party
to a suit, attorney, or judge. It is in each of these capacities
that the Negro in the court room is to be considered,
but some of them permit of only brief mention.
How the Negro actually fares in the court room—whether
he gets justice as often as the white person does, whether
his testimony has as much weight with the jury and court
as that of the white witness, whether the Negro attorney
or judge is accorded as much courtesy as the white man
in a similar position—would make an interesting and
profitable study, but such a study is largely outside the
field of this investigation. It should be kept in mind now,
as in the previous chapters, that only those distinctions
are considered which have come within the pale of the
law since 1865, either in the form of statutory enactment
or judicial decision. Where mention is made of some of
the actual extralegal race distinctions in the court room,
it is only for illustration.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>AS SPECTATOR</h3>

<p class='c012'>The court room, while the court is in session, is open to
all citizens, regardless of race or color. No instance has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>been found either in the statutes or judicial reports of
one’s admission to or exclusion from the court room being
dependent upon his race or color. It is to be noticed,
however, in Southern court rooms that the spectators are
separated by race, Negroes usually occupying seats on one
side of the room and white people on the other. This
must be entirely a matter of custom, as no case has been
found of such separation being required by law or ordinance.
While this point has not been deemed important
enough for a special investigation, it is presumed that one
will find the races separated in the court room in those
States or communities where they are separated in other
places—as in public conveyances, schools, and churches.</p>

<p class='c007'>A Negro in the South, as elsewhere, has, legally and
actually, as good an opportunity to observe court proceedings
as a white person, though custom may require him to
sit in a different part of the court room from that occupied
by the latter.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>AS JUDGE</h3>

<p class='c012'>Little within the scope of this chapter can be said of
the Negro as a judge. There are cases still in the North of
Negroes sitting on the bench, mostly in lower courts, and
there may be instances, here and there, in the South, of
Negroes holding judicial offices. Certainly, the Negro
elector is eligible, both under Federal and State Constitutions,
to hold a judgeship. Whether or not there are
Negroes on the bench in a given State is not determined
by the legislatures or the courts, but by the appointing
power or by the choice of the people at the polls.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>
  <h3 class='c013'>AS LAWYER</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>A Negro is eligible to practice law in every State; that
is, nothing to the contrary appears in any of the State or
Federal statutes now in force. Negroes may be admitted
to the bar everywhere upon proving the same qualifications
and passing the same examinations as required of other
applicants for license. But this has not always been so.
The privilege of practicing law in Iowa,<a id='r589' /><a href='#f589' class='c014'><sup>[589]</sup></a> for instance,
was, until 1870, restricted to white males. In that year
it was extended to women and to members of other races
than the white. Only one State appears to have considered
it needful to guarantee by statutory enactment the
right to practice law to the Negro. An act of the Colorado<a id='r590' /><a href='#f590' class='c014'><sup>[590]</sup></a>
legislature in 1897 reads: “No persons shall be denied
the right to practice as aforesaid on account of race
or sex.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1877, a Negro, with a license to practice law in
Massachusetts and the Circuit and District courts of the
United States in the city of Baltimore, applied for a
license to practice in the State courts of Maryland. The
laws of Maryland<a id='r591' /><a href='#f591' class='c014'><sup>[591]</sup></a> of 1872 limited the privilege of admission
to the bar to white male citizens. The Negro brought
suit because he was refused admission to the Maryland bar,
and the Court of Appeals of Maryland<a id='r592' /><a href='#f592' class='c014'><sup>[592]</sup></a> held that the
State had a right to limit the privilege of practicing law
to white males, holding that such a limitation did not
violate the Fourteenth Amendment. The court said, in
part: “The privilege of admission to the office of an attorney
cannot be said to be a right or immunity belonging to
the citizen, but is governed and regulated by the Legislature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>which may prescribe the qualifications required and
designate the class of persons who may be admitted. The
power of regulating the admission of attorneys in the
courts of a State is one belonging to the State, and not
to the Federal Government. As said by Mr. Justice Bradley
in Bradwell’s case:<a id='r593' /><a href='#f593' class='c014'><sup>[593]</sup></a> ‘In the nature of things it is not
every citizen of every age, sex and condition that is qualified
for every calling and position. It is the prerogative
of the legislator to prescribe regulations founded on nature,
reason and experience, for the due admission of qualified
persons to professions and callings demanding special
skill and confidence. This fairly belongs to the police
power of the State.’” According to the opinion in this
case, which has not been overruled so far as has been
found, a State legislature may, in the exercise of its
police power, limit the privilege of practicing law to white males
or to white people, and thus debar the Negro altogether.
In the latest collection of Maryland laws, however,
that of 1904, no mention is made of race in the
prescribed qualifications for admission to the bar, but no
express repeal has been found in the annual statutes of the
law of 1872 which limited the privilege of practicing law
to white males. The presumption is, however, that Maryland,
in common with the other States, now admits Negro
applicants on the same terms as white.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is generally known that Negro lawyers in the Southern
States are few, and it is considered that the field there
for the Negro lawyer is not promising. There were seven
hundred and twenty-eight Negro lawyers in the United
States in 1900. The following notice in <cite>The Emmanuel
Magazine</cite> of July 3, 1909, a monthly publication by a Negro
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>in Washington, North Carolina, is interesting in this connection:
“Mr. E. W. Canady, a respectable colored lawyer
of Durham, N. C., not long since received three thousand
four hundred dollars for his service at the bar in representing
one case. This speaks more for him than anything
else possibly could. It shows the public’s confidence
in his ability both as a lawyer and a gentleman of integrity.
It also shows that, at least in some cases, a Negro
can get justice in a Southern court, not only for himself,
but for others. The profession of law is the most difficult
one a colored man can follow in the South, because he
must deal with white judges, white jurors, white lawyers,
and, sometimes, white witnesses, and a public sentiment
which is created by the whites. If he keep his soul well
equipoised and act gently and manfully—not bootlicking,
but seeking the peace of the city wherein he dwelleth, as
Jeremiah advised the Jews of Babylon to do, he can fare
equally as well, if not better, in the South as he can in
the North. I was not a little surprised when I asked Mr.
Canady how the judges treated him and he said, ‘Oh,
they’ll treat you all right, if you act rightly; they are
bound to follow the law, you know.’ This should encourage
more young men to take up this profession.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>AS WITNESS</h3>

<p class='c012'>When one comes to the Negro as a witness, he finds
much legislation and many judicial decisions, but they are
confined largely to the first years after Emancipation; that
is, to the years during which the rights and privileges of
the Negro as a freeman were being defined and fixed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>The Negro slave had been either deemed incompetent as a
witness, or, if deemed competent, his testimony was admitted
only in certain actions.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1866, a white man in Kentucky was indicted for
entering the house of a Negro and committing larceny.
At the time a Negro in that State could not testify against
a white man. A Circuit Court<a id='r594' /><a href='#f594' class='c014'><sup>[594]</sup></a> of the United States decided
that it could take jurisdiction of this case under the
Civil Rights Bill of 1866, holding that the Negro, as a
citizen, had the right to be a witness in court. This
appears to be the only case in which the Federal court has
adjudicated upon the right of a Negro to testify.</p>

<p class='c007'>A law of Alabama<a id='r595' /><a href='#f595' class='c014'><sup>[595]</sup></a> of 1865 made Negroes competent
to testify only in open court and only in cases, civil or
criminal, to which a freedman, free Negro, or mulatto,
was a party. This was reënacted in 1867.<a id='r596' /><a href='#f596' class='c014'><sup>[596]</sup></a> In 1886, a
white man in Mobile was tried for the murder of a Negro.
All the witnesses for the prosecution were Negroes, and all
for the defendant, white people. The question of the color
of witnesses was raised, and the city court of Mobile
charged: “... it is immaterial whether the witnesses
were white or black, if you believe beyond a reasonable
doubt that black witnesses are telling the truth, it is as
much your duty to convict on their evidence as though
they were white.” There was an exception to this charge,
but the Supreme Court of Alabama<a id='r597' /><a href='#f597' class='c014'><sup>[597]</sup></a> overruled the exception.
The present law of Alabama seems to be that the
color of the witness is immaterial in determining his competency.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Supreme Court of Arkansas,<a id='r598' /><a href='#f598' class='c014'><sup>[598]</sup></a> in 1869, held that
by the Civil Rights Bill of 1866 the laws prohibiting Negroes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>from testifying became inoperative. No other case
on the point seems to have arisen in the State.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Constitution<a id='r599' /><a href='#f599' class='c014'><sup>[599]</sup></a> of Florida of 1865 permitted Negroes
to testify only in proceedings founded upon injury
to a Negro or in cases affecting the rights and remedies
of Negroes. A statute<a id='r600' /><a href='#f600' class='c014'><sup>[600]</sup></a> of the same year, relative to
testimony in general, provided that the testimony of Negroes
should not be taken by deposition in writing or upon
written interrogation, or “otherwise than in such manner
as will enable the court or jury to judge the credibility
of the witness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Constitution<a id='r601' /><a href='#f601' class='c014'><sup>[601]</sup></a> of Georgia of 1865 made it the
duty of the general assembly to provide laws prescribing in
what cases the testimony of Negroes should be admitted in
the courts. This is the only reference to the Negro as a
witness found in the Georgia statutes or court reports.</p>

<p class='c007'>Kentucky,<a id='r602' /><a href='#f602' class='c014'><sup>[602]</sup></a> in 1865, provided that Negroes and mulattoes
should be competent witnesses in all civil proceedings
in which Negroes or mulattoes were the only parties
interested in the issue, and in all criminal proceedings in
which Negroes or mulattoes were the defendants. In 1867,
the Court of Appeals of Kentucky<a id='r603' /><a href='#f603' class='c014'><sup>[603]</sup></a> held that the law of
Kentucky prohibiting a Negro from testifying against a
white person was still in force and was not rendered inoperative
by the Civil Rights Bill of 1866.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Constitution<a id='r604' /><a href='#f604' class='c014'><sup>[604]</sup></a> of Maryland of 1867 provided
that no person should be incompetent as a witness on account
of race or color unless thereafter so declared by an
act of the general assembly. The general assembly appears
not to have acted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mississippi,<a id='r605' /><a href='#f605' class='c014'><sup>[605]</sup></a> in 1865, provided that freedmen, free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>Negroes, and mulattoes, should be competent in all civil
cases to which a freedman, free Negro, or mulatto was a
party, and in criminal cases in which the crime charged
was alleged to have been committed by a white person
upon a freedman, free Negro, or mulatto. But in 1867,
Negroes were given the right to testify on the same terms
as white people.<a id='r606' /><a href='#f606' class='c014'><sup>[606]</sup></a> In 1865, South Carolina<a id='r607' /><a href='#f607' class='c014'><sup>[607]</sup></a> declared
that Negroes might testify in cases to which a person of
color was a party. Tennessee,<a id='r608' /><a href='#f608' class='c014'><sup>[608]</sup></a> the same year, provided
that Negroes and Indians should be competent as witnesses
“in as full measure as such persons are by an act
of Congress competent witnesses in all the courts of the
United States.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Constitution<a id='r609' /><a href='#f609' class='c014'><sup>[609]</sup></a> of Texas of 1866 contains the following
section: “Africans and their descendants shall not
be prohibited, on account of their color or race, from testifying
orally, as witnesses, in any case, civil or criminal,
involving the right of injury to, or crime against, any of
them in person or property, under the same rules of evidence
that may be applicable to the white race; the credibility
of their testimony to be determined by the court
or jury hearing the same; and the legislature shall have
power to authorize them to testify as witnesses in all other
cases, under such regulations that may be prescribed, as to
facts hereafter occurring.” In pursuance of this authority,
the legislature<a id='r610' /><a href='#f610' class='c014'><sup>[610]</sup></a> enacted that persons of color should
not testify except where a prosecution was against a person
of color or where the alleged offence was against the
person or property of a person of color. But in 1868, the
Supreme Court<a id='r611' /><a href='#f611' class='c014'><sup>[611]</sup></a> of Texas held that the first section of
the Civil Rights Bill gave Negroes the right to testify,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>and in 1871 the legislature<a id='r612' /><a href='#f612' class='c014'><sup>[612]</sup></a> said that in the courts of that
State there shall be no exclusion of any witness on account
of color.</p>

<p class='c007'>Virginia,<a id='r613' /><a href='#f613' class='c014'><sup>[613]</sup></a> in 1866, provided that Negroes and Indians
should be competent to testify in cases in which a Negro
or Indian was a party. The testimony of Negroes had to
be “<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ore tenus</span></i>, and not by deposition.” The next year,
this law was repealed and a statute<a id='r614' /><a href='#f614' class='c014'><sup>[614]</sup></a> enacted that colored
persons should be competent to testify “as if they were
white.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus far the legislation on Negro testimony in the
Southern States only has been given. Similar questions
have arisen in some of the other States. Thus, by an early
statute of California<a id='r615' /><a href='#f615' class='c014'><sup>[615]</sup></a> “no Indian, or person having one-half
or more Indian blood, or Mongolian, or Chinese,” was
permitted to give evidence in favor of or against a white
person. The Supreme Court<a id='r616' /><a href='#f616' class='c014'><sup>[616]</sup></a> of the State held in 1869
that this statute violated the Civil Rights Bill and was
therefore null and void. A minority of the court, however,
dissented on the ground that the Civil Rights Bill itself
was unconstitutional as interfering with the domestic
relations of citizens.</p>

<p class='c007'>A law of Indiana<a id='r617' /><a href='#f617' class='c014'><sup>[617]</sup></a> of 1865 provided that all persons
of competent age, without distinction as to color or blood,
should be competent as witnesses, but provided that no
Negro or mulatto who had come, or who should thereafter
come into this State in violation of the thirteenth article
of the Constitution of the State (prohibiting the immigration
of free Negroes) should, while said article continued
in force, be competent as a witness in any case in which a
white person was a party in interest. It also provided<a id='r618' /><a href='#f618' class='c014'><sup>[618]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>that where a Negro, Indian, or person excluded on account
of mixed blood was a party in the case, his opponent
should be excluded. Nevada,<a id='r619' /><a href='#f619' class='c014'><sup>[619]</sup></a> the same year, gave Negroes
the right to testify, but not in favor of or against
a white person, and also provided that the credibility of
such Negro, black, or mulatto person should be left entirely
with the jury. Washington,<a id='r620' /><a href='#f620' class='c014'><sup>[620]</sup></a> in 1866, provided
that no one should be incompetent as a witness “by reason
of having Negro blood.” But in 1869, the legislature<a id='r621' /><a href='#f621' class='c014'><sup>[621]</sup></a>
said that Indians or persons having over one-half Indian
blood should not be competent to testify in an action or
proceeding to which a white person was a party. West
Virginia<a id='r622' /><a href='#f622' class='c014'><sup>[622]</sup></a> passed a law in 1866 that no person should be
incompetent as a witness on account of race or color.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the first years after Emancipation, the States
were very doubtful of the Negro’s fitness as a witness. In
saying, as many of them did, that he could be a witness
only in cases in which a Negro was a party, they were following
the “Black Laws” before the War, to which reference
was made in the chapter on “The Black Laws of
1865–68.” That they were doubtful of the testimony of
the Negro is shown by the provision of the act that the
Negro’s credibility should be the subject of a special
charge by the court and that his testimony should be given
orally. It has been seen that some of the States soon repealed
their laws discriminating against the Negro as a
witness, and that others enacted statutes allowing him to
testify upon the same terms and conditions as a white person.
In some of the States, the records do not show that
the right to testify in court has yet been given to the
Negro. But it must be taken as settled that, even in those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>States which are silent on the subject, the Negro does
have the same right to testify as the white person. How
much weight is actually given to his testimony is a matter
not of law, but of fact, to be determined by the trier
of fact, or jury, as the case may be. It may be said, in
short, that, at present, the right of the Negro to testify in
court is precisely co-extensive with the right of the white
person.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>AS JUROR</h3>

<p class='c012'>Most of the legislation and suits concerning the Negro
as a witness came during the years between 1865 and
1870. Since then, the right of the Negro to testify in
court has been generally undisputed. With the Negro as
a juror, it has been different. There has not been a great
deal of legislation about the Negro as a juror, not even
during the years 1865–70 which were so prolific of race
legislation. But the court reports from 1865 have been
abundantly supplied with cases that have to do with the
Negro as a juror, not referring so much to his right to
serve as to his actual service on the jury. First, reference
will be made to the legislation on the topic, then a number
of cases will be discussed, most of which have turned upon
a few fundamental principles of constitutional law, and,
finally, a word will be said of Negro jury service as it
actually exists.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fourth section of the Civil Rights Bill<a id='r623' /><a href='#f623' class='c014'><sup>[623]</sup></a> of 1875
reads: “That no citizen possessing all other qualifications
which are or may be prescribed by law shall be disqualified
for service as grand or petit juror in any court of the
United States, or of any State, on account of race, color,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>or previous condition of servitude, and any officer or other
person charged with any duty in the selection or summoning
of jurors who shall exclude or fail to summon any citizen
for the cause aforesaid shall, upon conviction thereof,
be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and be fined not more
than five thousand dollars.” As was seen in the previous
chapter on the civil rights of Negroes, the first sections of
the Civil Rights Bill were declared unconstitutional in
1883. But, as will be seen in the discussion of the cases
that have arisen about the Negro as a juror, the section
quoted above has stood the test of constitutionality and is
still a part of our Federal statute law.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the States outside the South saw, in 1883, that
the Federal Government was impotent to secure civil
rights to Negroes, they began to enact Civil Rights Bills
of their own, which virtually copied the Federal statutes
of 1875. The following States enacted statutes practically
the same as the Federal law referring to jury service: Indiana,<a id='r624' /><a href='#f624' class='c014'><sup>[624]</sup></a>
in 1885; Michigan,<a id='r625' /><a href='#f625' class='c014'><sup>[625]</sup></a> in 1885; New York,<a id='r626' /><a href='#f626' class='c014'><sup>[626]</sup></a> in 1895;
Ohio,<a id='r627' /><a href='#f627' class='c014'><sup>[627]</sup></a> in 1884, and Rhode Island,<a id='r628' /><a href='#f628' class='c014'><sup>[628]</sup></a> in 1885. The only
difference between these State statutes and the Federal
statute is in the punishment for keeping a person off the
jury because of his race or color. Indiana and Michigan
impose a fine of not less than one hundred dollars or imprisonment
of not more than thirty days, or both; New
York imposes a fine of from one hundred dollars to five
hundred dollars or imprisonment from thirty to ninety
days, or both; Ohio imposes a fine from fifty dollars to five
hundred dollars or imprisonment between thirty and
ninety days, or both; Rhode Island imposes a fine not to
exceed one hundred dollars. This is practically all of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>the jury legislation outside the South, which has been
found.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Arkansas,<a id='r629' /><a href='#f629' class='c014'><sup>[629]</sup></a> in 1867, a law granting certain rights to
Negroes had the following provision: “That nothing herein
contained shall be construed to repeal or modify any statute
or common law usage of this State respecting&nbsp;... service
on juries.” Though nothing is said of it, one may infer
that this meant that Negroes were not to sit on juries. A
Louisiana<a id='r630' /><a href='#f630' class='c014'><sup>[630]</sup></a> law of 1880 states that, in the selection of
jurors, “there shall be no distinction made on account of
race, color, or previous condition.” This State at the time
was in the hands of the Reconstructionists. Mississippi,<a id='r631' /><a href='#f631' class='c014'><sup>[631]</sup></a>
in 1867, provided that freedmen should not be competent
to serve as petit or grand jurors. A law of Tennessee<a id='r632' /><a href='#f632' class='c014'><sup>[632]</sup></a> of
1866, giving Negroes the right to testify, had the provision
that it should not be construed to give colored persons the
right to sit on juries in that State. The same year, a
law<a id='r633' /><a href='#f633' class='c014'><sup>[633]</sup></a> repealing certain other acts had the provision that
nothing in the act should be construed to admit persons of
color to serve on the jury. But in 1868, the Negroes of
Tennessee<a id='r634' /><a href='#f634' class='c014'><sup>[634]</sup></a> were given full rights in this respect. This
appears to be all of the legislation as to Negro jurors in
the South between 1865 and the present.</p>

<p class='c007'>That the statute of 1875 prohibiting the exclusion of
persons from jury service on account of race, color, or previous
condition of servitude is constitutional, has been
decided in a series of cases before the Supreme Court of
the United States.<a id='r635' /><a href='#f635' class='c014'><sup>[635]</sup></a> The mere fact that no Negroes are
on a certain jury does not indicate that the Fourteenth
Amendment, under which all these jury cases arise, has
been violated; it must be shown that the Negroes were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>kept off the jury consciously by State officials because of
their race, color, or previous condition.<a id='r636' /><a href='#f636' class='c014'><sup>[636]</sup></a> The Fourteenth
Amendment is violated, however, when the officers of the
State keep Negroes off the juries for these causes. The
Supreme Court<a id='r637' /><a href='#f637' class='c014'><sup>[637]</sup></a> of the United States said in 1899:
“Whenever by an action of a State, whether through its
legislature, through its courts, or through its executive or
administrative officers, all persons of the African race are
excluded, solely because of their race or color, from serving
as grand jurors in the criminal prosecution of a person of
the African race, the equal protection of the laws is denied
to him contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A custom seems to have grown up among some lawyers,
particularly in the South, to move to quash the indictment
whenever a Negro is on trial for a crime and there are
no Negroes on the grand jury. With almost absolute
uniformity, the State courts have held that there is no
ground for quashing the indictment unless it is shown that
Negroes were kept off the juries purposely and because of
their race or color.<a id='r638' /><a href='#f638' class='c014'><sup>[638]</sup></a> The cases show also that, if a Negro
is kept off the grand jury because of his race, there is
ground for quashing the indictment. Texas has furnished
far more of these jury cases than any other Southern State.
Wherever the jury commissioners have betrayed in any
way the fact that they kept Negroes off the juries because
of their race, the indictment has been quashed. A few
instances will suffice. In one case the commissioners said
that they did not put Negroes on the jury because they
considered them unfit; this was held<a id='r639' /><a href='#f639' class='c014'><sup>[639]</sup></a> to be in violation
of the Fourteenth Amendment. When, again, they said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>that they kept Negroes off the juries because their presence
“would be offensive to the white jurors,” the indictment
was quashed.<a id='r640' /><a href='#f640' class='c014'><sup>[640]</sup></a> In a county of 11,000 voters in
Texas, about 1,000 of them were Negroes, of whom 600
or 700 were competent to be jurors. No Negro had ever
been on a jury there. The commissioners admitted that
they would not put a Negro on if they knew it. The
indictment was quashed.<a id='r641' /><a href='#f641' class='c014'><sup>[641]</sup></a> In another case,<a id='r642' /><a href='#f642' class='c014'><sup>[642]</sup></a> they said
they would not put Negroes on juries because it would
create a conflict between the races which would injure
the Negroes. This was held a sufficient admission to
quash the indictment. In a case arising as late as 1903,
the commissioners undertook to satisfy the Fourteenth
Amendment by putting on a Negro. They put on a Negro
who had either moved out of the county or was dead.
This was held to be enough of a race discrimination to
quash the indictment.<a id='r643' /><a href='#f643' class='c014'><sup>[643]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>No matter how large a percentage of the population
is colored, if it is not proved that Negroes were kept off
the jury because of race or color, there is no ground for
objection. Thus, it was found that a Negro had never
been known to sit on a grand jury in Bexar County,
Texas, where there were 7,000 or 8,000 possible jurors,
of whom 600 or 700 were colored. It was not proved,
however, that they were kept off on account of race or
color, and it was held that there was no ground for
quashing an indictment.<a id='r644' /><a href='#f644' class='c014'><sup>[644]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The following interesting case arose in Utah in 1900:
A white person refused to serve on a jury with a Negro,
and wrote a note making a complaint. The Negro was
thereupon excluded from the jury. Later, the Negro
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>brought an action against the white man to recover damages
to the extent of the jury fees. The court held<a id='r645' /><a href='#f645' class='c014'><sup>[645]</sup></a> that,
while color was not a test of one’s fitness to be a juror, a
written objection to serve on a jury with a Negro is no
ground for an action for damages by a colored man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The latest case of race distinction in juries comes
from Oklahoma. There were four Negroes on a jury, and
for that reason the judge discharged the jury. He said
that the State had separate cars, separate schools, and
separate tables for Negroes and whites, and “he would
not insult white men by making them serve on a jury with
Negroes.” The case is so recent as to be reported, as yet,
only in the newspapers.<a id='r646' /><a href='#f646' class='c014'><sup>[646]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The constitutional right of the Negro to serve on a jury
or to be tried before a jury composed, in whole or in part,
of Negroes, is well expressed in a recent Texas case<a id='r647' /><a href='#f647' class='c014'><sup>[647]</sup></a> as
follows: “It is not a question as to the right of a Negro, or
any number of Negroes, to sit on a grand jury, that the
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United
State was intended to provide for; but it was intended,
where a Negro was on trial, to prevent discrimination
against the Negro race in the formation of the grand jury,
which presented the indictment, and only in case Negroes
are intentionally excluded from the grand jury is he denied
the equal protection of the laws. It was never intended
by the Fourteenth Amendment to guaranty a Negro
defendant a full Negro grand jury, or to guaranty to him
any particular number of grand jurors, but it was intended
to prevent intentional exclusion from the grand
jury.”</p>

  <h4 class='c011'><em>Actual Jury Service by Negroes in South</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>In treating the Negro as a juror, the writer departed
from the habit of confining his discussion to the race distinctions
manifested in statutes and judicial reports. As
he went through the statutes and reports, these questions
arose in his mind: Do Negroes actually serve on the juries
in those communities where they are numerous? If so,
what satisfaction have they given? In order to obtain answers
to these questions, he sent out letters to the clerks
of court in every county in the Southern States in which
Negroes constituted one-half or more of the population in
1900. Over three hundred letters were sent out containing
the following inquiry: “I wish to know to what extent
Negroes actually serve on juries, how Negro jurors
are regarded by the court and the people at large, whether
the number of colored jurors has increased or decreased
in late years, what has been the experience of your county
as to the satisfaction of colored jurors?” Of course, as
many replies were not received; but the replies that were
received indicate the extent of Negro jury service in the
Southern States. These replies will be quoted from freely
in each case, the State and the number of Negroes and
white people in the particular county will be given, but
not the name of the county.</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Alabama.</em>—County No. 1, 10,000 white people, 13,000
Negroes: “Negroes are not allowed to sit upon juries in
this county. It sometimes happens that names of Negroes
are placed in our jury-box by mistake on the part of the
jury commissioners, and are regularly drawn to serve as
jurors; this, however, is a very rare occurrence. Once in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>the past four years, a Negro was drawn as a grand juror
(by mistake) who appeared and insisted upon the court’s
impaneling him with other jurors, which was done in accordance
with law, the court having no legal right to discharge
or excuse him. My recollection is he served two
days, when he was taken out at night and severely beaten,
and was then discharged on his own petition by the court.
This will convey to your mind that Negro jurors are not
very wholesomely regarded and tolerated in this county.
The fact is, Negroes have never been or never will be
allowed to sit on juries in this county.”</p>

thing for them to be in the majority. I believe the Negroes
are fairly well pleased with the verdicts of all white

a jury in this court, and the probability is, it will be many
more. Negroes are not regarded as good jurors, and I believe
it to be a fact that a Negro would prefer being tried
by a white jury than a mixed jury, or a jury composed
wholly of Negroes; this applies to both civil and criminal

“... in the circuit court of the State it is very seldom

of the elder Negroes are illiterate and because most of the
younger ones that remain here are of other than fair character,
there are but few Negroes, about one per cent., whose
names are drawn or selected to go into the jury-box. If
one is drawn as juror&nbsp;... he serves as such juror, and
no one has ever objected to one so far as I know of. My
experience covers a period of ten years, during which time&nbsp;... we have had only two Negroes drawn as jurors. No
person has ever appealed a case on account of not having
a Negro on the jury, nor has there been anything said outside

from jury duty.”</p>

State: “Negro jurors are sometimes selected in various
parts of the State, and I presume all over the State.
Twenty years ago the custom was more prevalent than at
present of putting Negroes on the juries. They were the
best class of Negroes, and I am reliably informed that in
various parts of the State the Negroes themselves requested
to be left off the juries, which may account for
the fact that the practice seems to have fallen into disuse.”</p>

<p class='c007'><em>Louisiana.</em>—Parish No. 1, 3,900 white people, 12,700

dropped out and for several years [we] have had no
Negroes at all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Parish No. 2, 8,800 white people, 11,300 Negroes:
“... Negroes serve as jurors in this parish to a limited
extent. The jury commissioners, when they know of an
exceptionally good, honest, sober and industrious Negro,
have no objections to placing his name in the jury-box.
It is true, however, that the number is very limited,
owing to the fact that very few Negroes will come to the
standard as far as the above qualifications are concerned.
Out of the 300 names in the jury-box from which we draw
our juries, there are about a dozen Negroes. The Negroes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>as jurors do not give any trouble; they always follow the
suggestions and advice of the white jurors.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Parish No. 3, 11,000 white people, 17,800 Negroes:
“... in this parish Negroes have served on both our
grand and petit juries ever since the Civil War. Only the
very best of our Negroes are drawn on the jury; they
usually constitute about one-half of the panel on the petit
jury and on the grand jury they are always represented,
but in a much smaller proportion. The number of Negroes
with us fit for jury service is not increasing as one would
think would be the case considering their advantage for an
education. They render very good service, rather prone to
convict in serious personal injury cases, inflict capital punishment
more readily than white juries and generally want
all law enforced, especially against bad men of their own
race, as they know this is their best protection.”</p>

Negroes to sit on the grand jury in our parish. There are
three names of Negroes in the jury-box that we draw our

idiots, insane persons, and Indians not taxed, who is a citizen
of the United States, twenty-one years old and upwards,
who resided in the State two years, and one year
in the election district, or in the incorporated city or town

has never been convicted of bribery, burglary, theft, arson,
obtaining money or goods under false pretenses, perjury,
forgery, embezzlement or bigamy, and who has paid, on or
before the first day of February of the year in which he
shall offer to vote, all taxes which have been legally required
of him, and is able to read any section of the Constitution
of the State, or is able to understand the same,
when read to him, is a qualified voter, and can be a member
of either our grand jury or a petit jury if drawn as
such. Our Negro jurors are either ministers or school
teachers, with some farmers. The majority of them fail
to pay their taxes, which disqualifies them from jury service.
Negro jurors are not regarded by our courts as good
jurymen, but we are compelled to use them when drawn
and they are qualified to serve.”</p>

“In my judicial district there are five counties, in three of
which Negroes serve upon the juries in about the proportion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>that they are qualified under the law. The qualifications
for jurors are very strict in this State and comparatively
few Negroes can qualify legally. In limited numbers
they make very satisfactory jurors when the rights of
their people are involved. As a rule, a Negro does not
like to try a white man’s case; they are much more inclined
to convict Negroes charged with crime than are the white
jurors, and Negro defendants always challenge Negro
jurors. In the ‘Black Belt’ of Mississippi, a Negro can
always receive a fair trial in the courts, but this is not so
certain in the white counties. In the two counties where
Negroes do not serve upon the juries, there are practically
no Negroes qualified under the law, because none are registered
voters.”</p>

But the Board of Supervisors draws the names
of 200 or more persons on the first Monday of January
in each year and puts them in a box, so many for each
supervisor’s district. But of late years the supervisors
have not put many names of Negroes in the jury-box;
therefore, we have not had very [many] Negro jurors.
But we have one or two Negro jurors nearly every term
of our court [circuit court]....”</p>

and no man is excluded from the jury on account of his
color.... In some of the counties of the State, the
boards of supervisors select some Negroes for jury service,
but the great trouble is, there are comparatively few
Negroes in any county, and none in some of the counties,
who can measure up to the qualifications prescribed
by law.... The criminal element in Mississippi is composed
largely of the Negro race, and as a matter of
fact, the persons of that race charged with crime and the
lawyers who defend them, the large majority of whom are
of the white race, do not want Negroes on the jury, and
Negroes are almost invariably challenged. If Negroes
chance to be summoned on a special venire in a capital
case with white men, they [the Negroes] disqualify to
avoid service, sometimes by claiming that they are not
registered voters, but generally by claiming that they are
opposed to the death penalty.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The following incident happened in one of our courts
and may help to shed some light on the subject-matter
wanted: A Negro was indicted for manslaughter. He was
too poor to employ counsel to conduct his case, and it not
being a capital case, the court could not appoint counsel
for him, and told him so. He said he would do the best
he could without a lawyer, and the court told him of his
rights under the law, that he could look over the jury, and
of his right to challenge four of them if he was dissatisfied
with the panel as it stood. There were four Negroes on
the jury, and he very promptly advised the court that he
was not satisfied; the court told him he had a right to
object to four of them, and he very quickly told the court,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>‘Ef dat is so, dem niggers can stand aside.’ They were
excused by the court, and the sheriff was ordered to complete
the panel from the very best citizens to be had,

have a term of court without having several Negroes on
it, besides we always have Negroes on the trial juries.
It is not often that they sit on a case unless a Negro lawyer
has one side of it. They do not believe in convicting
one of their color. They are objectionable in every sense
of the word. They are not regarded by the other members
of the jury. Negro jurors are on the increase in recent
years....”</p>

have served as jurors either in our court or in any
justice of the peace court in this county. While probably
under our laws Negroes would be legal jurors, the county
court of this county will not draw them as jurors, and
the Sheriff, when he has to get jurors, will not summon
them. And I do not believe our lawyers here would
permit a Negro to remain on a jury before which they
would have to try a case. Further, I am sure that no
white man here would serve on a jury with a Negro, even
though his refusal to so serve would subject him to a

as drawn from the same on orders from the various divisions
of court. A few of the more intelligent Negroes are
placed on the jury list. I made inquiry when two Negroes
served on a jury last week. The other jurors did not seem
to feel any antipathy. Of course, a little surprise was
manifested at seeing them in court when their names were
called. Neither the attorneys for the plaintiff nor [for]
the defence challenged them but accepted them on the

serve on the juries in this county for the reasons that they
are an illiterate race and moral character not what it
should be. Further, he is easily influenced, deciding with
a juror whom he may like instead of weighing the evidence
and deciding accordingly. The number of Negro
jurors has decreased for the past few years on account of
the Negro of to-day [being] morally not as good as the
Negro of several years ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>County No. 2, 11,000 white people, 19,000 Negroes: “I
will say that Negroes do not serve on the jury in this

government in our hands. When the Republican party
was in power Negroes were drawn, both regular and talis
jurors, and not one out of one hundred was a competent
juror, but, strange to say, when a Negro was on trial, he
would always prefer the white men to try his case.”</p>

<p class='c007'>County No. 3, 5,800 white people, 8,300 Negroes:
“Negroes occasionally serve on juries in&nbsp;... county,
but not to as great extent as they did before the passage
of the Amendment [the suffrage amendment in 1900].
The County Commissioners have been more particular
about the names that are left in the box from which jurors
are drawn. Only the best, most reliable and most intelligent
Negroes are left in the box. Sometimes it happens
that a few are called as talismen, but not then until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>sheriff has exhausted his best efforts to get white men.
Those called are very apt to be good, reliable men, and
with a majority of white men in the jury-box are not disposed
or able to do wrong. My experience as clerk for 20
years is that they make good jurors, and are apt to be
disposed, in criminal actions, to execute the law even
against their own race. Judge&nbsp;... says that white men
on the jury are everywhere disposed to lean toward a
Negro litigant, especially if the Negro is of the old-class,
before-the-war Negro gentleman and the white man is of
these later days ‘common trash.’ I am told by the judges
that in some counties the sheriffs would not dare to call a
Negro as a talisman even, but, as I have said, we have
them not very frequently and without complaint. I notice
that the opposing lawyers are slow in challenging them
when so called....”</p>

the names of only good, respectable Negroes in the jury

our juries, but those we have are well disposed and the
most intelligent Negroes of the county, and make very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>acceptable jurors. I have been struck with the fact that
our lawyers in selecting the jury for both criminal and
civil cases, seldom ever object to the Negroes who are on
the regular panel. If this is always kept up, with only
the best and most intelligent Negroes in the county in
the jury-box, all will be well and our people will not object.
But in former years, when sometimes the majority
of the jury would be Negroes, there was great dissatisfaction.”</p>

names in the box, but they did not happen to be drawn by
the Sheriff or myself. The men who have sat have given
satisfaction to the litigants, but have been objectionable to
the other jurors. Where it has come to a locked-up jury,
and where they have to eat and be closely confined with
the white man, I have heard some complaint. The court

Negro litigants as they are to those of the other races.
There are a larger per cent. of Negroes in the district
court, and there is rarely any criticism. In fact, no prejudice
exists here against them as jurors, largely from the
fact that only our best Negro citizens are drawn on the

There is hardly ever a jury drawn without some Negroes

<p class='c007'><em>Summary</em>: With such incomplete statistics, conclusions
as to the actual service of the Negro as a juror can
hardly be more than guesses. Some of the clerks of court
say that the number of Negro jurors in their counties is
increasing; others, that it is decreasing. Some say that
race does not come into the consideration of fitness for
jury service; others, that Negroes are not allowed on juries
at all. Some say that Negro jurors have given satisfaction;
others, that they have been scarcely more than
figureheads following the lead of white jurors. Several
of the clerks think that Negro litigants are reluctant to
have Negro jurors sit on their cases. Some feel that
Negro jurors are more prone to convict than white jurors
are. It is undoubtedly true that there are not as many
Negroes qualified for jury service under the laws of the
Southern States as there were twenty-five years ago, say.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>Usually one must be an elector to be qualified for jury
service. The great majority of the Negroes have been unable
to satisfy the suffrage tests and have been disfranchised.
They are, consequently, not electors and not eligible to
serve as jurors. Hence, if the selection of jurors is conducted
with absolute impartiality, there will be comparatively
few Negroes retained.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SEPARATE COURTS</h3>

<p class='c012'>South Carolina appears to be the only State which
has ever provided a separate court for the trial of cases in
which Negroes have interests at issue. That was called
the District Court, provided for by a statute<a id='r648' /><a href='#f648' class='c014'><sup>[648]</sup></a> approved
December 19, 1865, which statute was repealed September
21, 1866; so the law was in force less than a year.
The seventh section of the act of forty-nine sections is:
“The District Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction, subject
to appeal, of all civil cases where one or both of the
parties are persons of color, and of all criminal cases
wherein the accused is a person of color, and also of all
cases of misdemeanor affecting the person or property
of a person of color, and of all cases of bastardy, and of
all cases of vagrancy, not tried before a Magistrate....”
The Magistrate was given jurisdiction over small disputes,
controversies and complaints that arose in his neighborhood
between persons of color, or between persons of color
and white persons, and of petty misdemeanors committed
by or toward persons of color, between master and servant,
between master and apprentice, and between employer and
laborer, and civil suits involving not over twenty dollars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>in which a person of color was a party. An indictment
of a white person for the homicide of a person of color
had to be tried in the regular superior court; and so had
all other indictments in which a white person was accused
of a capital felony affecting the person or property of a
person of color. In these forty-nine sections the jurisdiction
of this special court for persons of color is worked
out in detail; but inasmuch as the law was in force less
than a year and was one of the ephemeral “Black Laws”
already considered, there is no need to go into it further.
Suffice it to say that in the South at present, as in other
sections, the people of all races and colors have their rights
adjudicated by the same court.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>DIFFERENT PUNISHMENTS</h3>

<p class='c012'>Alabama, Florida, and Georgia prescribe a heavier punishment
for fornication and adultery between white people
and Negroes than between members of the same race.
On first consideration this appears to be a case of different
punishment. As was said by the Supreme Court of Alabama<a id='r649' /><a href='#f649' class='c014'><sup>[649]</sup></a>:
“The fact that a different punishment is affixed
to the offence of adultery when committed between a Negro
and a white person, and when committed between two
white persons or two Negroes, does not constitute a discrimination
against or in favor of either race. The
discrimination is not directed against the person of any
particular color or race, but against the offence, the nature
of which is determined by the opposite colors of the
cohabiting parties. The punishment of each offending
party, white and black, is precisely the same.” The constitutionality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>of these statutes as to cohabitation between
persons of different races has been upheld by the Supreme
Court of the United States.<a id='r650' /><a href='#f650' class='c014'><sup>[650]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The following are instances of race distinction in the
matter of offences and punishment. South Carolina,<a id='r651' /><a href='#f651' class='c014'><sup>[651]</sup></a> in
1865, said that a person of color who committed assault
upon a white woman with intent to ravish her, or who had
sexual intercourse with a white woman by impersonating
her husband, should be guilty of a felony “without benefit
of clergy.” Florida<a id='r652' /><a href='#f652' class='c014'><sup>[652]</sup></a> made it a capital crime to assault
a white female with intent to commit rape or to be accessory
thereto. Kentucky<a id='r653' /><a href='#f653' class='c014'><sup>[653]</sup></a> provided that all persons, without
distinction of color, would be subject to the same
pains and penalties for felonies and misdemeanors, adding:
“The laws now in force for the punishment of Negroes
and mulattoes for rape on white women are hereby
continued in force.” This was amended<a id='r654' /><a href='#f654' class='c014'><sup>[654]</sup></a> in 1869, but
the offence was still against white women. The race distinction
in these statutes lies in the fact that heavy
punishment was prescribed for an assault upon a white
woman, but no such protection was accorded a Negro
woman.</p>

<p class='c007'>South Carolina made it a felony “with benefit of
clergy” for a servant to steal a chattel, money, or valuable
security to the value of ten dollars belonging to, or in the
possession or power of his master or employer. It was an
“aggravated misdemeanor” for a servant to steal such
property below the value of five dollars. The servant had
no right to sell any farm produce without the written evidence
from his master or the District Judge or Magistrate
that he had a right to do so. But all such race distinctions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>in the matter of punishment passed away, as did the
other “Black Laws,” in 1866.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are certain statutes as to crimes which, though
they do not mention the Negro in so many words, are
thought by many to have peculiar application to him.
The vagrancy laws of the Southern States, for instance,
have been considered as directed primarily against Negroes.
Some of the States made it a crime for one to sell
cotton in bags between certain hours of the night. This
was probably a result of the habit attributed to the Negro
of hiding cotton in the jambs of the fences and woods in
the daytime to take to the cross-roads store at night. Missouri,<a id='r655' /><a href='#f655' class='c014'><sup>[655]</sup></a>
in 1903, made chicken-stealing a felony punishable
by imprisonment for five years, or a fine of two hundred
dollars. The next year, Kentucky<a id='r656' /><a href='#f656' class='c014'><sup>[656]</sup></a> passed the following
statute: “That if any person shall steal chickens, turkeys,
ducks, or other fowls of the value of two dollars, or
more, he shall be confined in the penitentiary not less
than one nor more than five years.” Whether this is an
indirect race distinction or not, the writer will not take
it upon himself to decide.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some of the States have enacted statutes to the effect
that the punishment for the members of all races shall be
the same for the same offence. Delaware<a id='r657' /><a href='#f657' class='c014'><sup>[657]</sup></a> did so in
1867. In Mississippi,<a id='r658' /><a href='#f658' class='c014'><sup>[658]</sup></a> in 1865, Negroes were given the
right to procure the arrest of a white person; but, if the
arrest were false and malicious, the Negro must pay all
the costs, be fined not over fifty dollars, and imprisoned
not over twenty days. In 1867, however, a statute
said that Negroes must have the same punishment as
white people. South Carolina,<a id='r659' /><a href='#f659' class='c014'><sup>[659]</sup></a> as has been seen, repealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>all laws prescribing different punishment for
Negroes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following interesting bit of news is taken from an
Associated Press report of July 21, 1909: “Mobile, Ala.—The
commissioners to-day established a curfew law for Negroes.
Commencing to-night, all the blacks must be at
home or in bed at 10 <span class='fss'>P.M.</span> Any of them caught wandering
at large will be locked up. This action is due to an
epidemic of hold-ups perpetrated by Negroes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A recent instance of race distinction in the court
room seems to come from New York. A Pullman porter,
named Griffin, was arrested in Montreal, charged with
stealing a pocket-book, but the charge was not substantiated
and he was released. He thereupon brought suit
against Daniel F. Brady, who caused his arrest, and obtained
a verdict for two thousand five hundred dollars in
damages. The Supreme Court of New York reduced the
damages from two thousand five hundred dollars to three
hundred dollars. Upon an appeal by Griffin, the appellate
division of the Supreme Court sustained the order reducing
the damages. The following is a part of the opinion
of Judge Drugo of the Supreme Court<a id='r660' /><a href='#f660' class='c014'><sup>[660]</sup></a> whose order was
sustained: “You cannot say that he [Griffin] is just the
same as a white man, when you come to say how much
his name will suffer. He might suffer more. But, after
all, what are the probabilities about it? Is it likely that
when a colored man is arrested and imprisoned he feels
just as much shame as a white man of any circumstance
might?</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think if you were to take the Mayor of the city and
arrest him he would feel very much more humiliated than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>this porter, from the fact that he was the Mayor and not
a colored man, for if a colored man he might not feel
quite as much humiliation and shame.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In one sense a colored man is just as good as a white
man, for the law says he is, but he has not the same amount
of injury under all circumstances that a white man would
have. Maybe in a colored community down South, where
white men were held in great disfavor, he might be more
injured, but after all that is not this sort of a community.
In this sort of a community, I dare say the amount of
evil that would flow to the colored man would not be as
great as it probably would be to a white man.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <span class='large'>SUFFRAGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States, ratified on March 30, 1870, reads: “The
right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not
be denied or abridged by the United States or by any
State on account of race, color, or previous condition of
servitude.” In the face of this unequivocal constitutional
provision, it would seem impossible to have a legal race
distinction in the matter of suffrage. It is plain that, if
a State or the United States makes a law that in any way
denies or abridges the right of a citizen to vote on account
of his race, such an enactment is in violation of the
Amendment. The only State or Federal statute or State
constitutional provision involving a race distinction that
would be valid under the Fifteenth Amendment would
be one that did not amount to a denial or abridgment
of the right to vote. For instance, a State might require
white and Negro electors to cast their ballots in different
boxes, or in different parts of the booth, or even in different
booths; or it might require them to register on
different days, or before different registrars. If the Negro
was given the same opportunity to register and vote as
the white man, the requirements of separate registering
and balloting would be race distinctions in the matter of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>suffrage, but they would not be denials or abridgments
of the right to vote and, hence, might be supported under
the Fifteenth Amendment. Any such requirements have
not been found in the State Constitutions or statutes;
they are only suggested as possible race distinctions which
might be permissible.</p>

<p class='c007'>It follows, therefore, that the race distinctions to be
considered in this chapter exist, not in conformity to law,
as in the case of separate schools and public conveyances,
but in defiance of law or by legal subterfuges, and are
properly called discriminations.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>NEGRO SUFFRAGE BEFORE 1865</h3>

<p class='c012'>The suffrage requirements as to race up to 1865 serve
as a background for the events after that date. A review<a id='r661' /><a href='#f661' class='c014'><sup>[661]</sup></a>
of the acts of territorial government and State Constitutions
of the Territories and States of the United States
reveals the following facts: Maine, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont appear not to
have had any race distinctions in suffrage. Alabama, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina,
and West Virginia never permitted any but white males
to vote at any time between the Revolution and 1865.
The Constitutions of Kansas<a id='r662' /><a href='#f662' class='c014'><sup>[662]</sup></a> of 1855 and of Minnesota<a id='r663' /><a href='#f663' class='c014'><sup>[663]</sup></a>
of 1857 permitted civilized Indians to vote, though the
same privilege was not extended to Negroes. Kentucky,<a id='r664' /><a href='#f664' class='c014'><sup>[664]</sup></a>
in 1799, gave the suffrage to “free” persons, but expressly
excepted Negroes, mulattoes, and Indians. Texas,<a id='r665' /><a href='#f665' class='c014'><sup>[665]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>in 1845, gave the right to vote to free male persons
but excepted Indians not taxed, Africans, and descendants
of Africans.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides the above-named States which either made no
race distinctions at all or else always made distinctions
as to Negroes, several States, at one time or another, extended
a limited suffrage to Negroes. The Constitution
of New York<a id='r666' /><a href='#f666' class='c014'><sup>[666]</sup></a> of 1821, giving the right to vote to male
citizens, had the provision that “no man of color, unless
he shall have been for three years a citizen of this State,
and for one year next preceding any election shall be
seized and possessed of a freehold estate of the value of
two hundred and fifty dollars, over and above all debts
and incumbrances charged thereon, and shall have been
actually rated and paid a tax thereon, shall be entitled to
vote at any such election.” There was no property test
for white voters. The Constitution<a id='r667' /><a href='#f667' class='c014'><sup>[667]</sup></a> of 1846 had the
same provision about Negro voters. The question of equal
suffrage to Negroes was submitted<a id='r668' /><a href='#f668' class='c014'><sup>[668]</sup></a> separately in 1846,
and rejected by a vote of 85,306 to 223,834. It was again
submitted in 1860, with like result, the vote being 197,503
to 337,984.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Constitution of North Carolina<a id='r669' /><a href='#f669' class='c014'><sup>[669]</sup></a> of 1835, as
amended, provided that no free Negro, free mulatto, or
free person of mixed blood, descended from Negro ancestors
to the fourth generation inclusive, though one ancestor
in each generation might have been a white person,
should vote for members of the “senate or house of commons”
of the State. Negroes who paid a certain poll
tax were allowed to vote until this Amendment went into
effect. Governor W. W. Kitchin,<a id='r670' /><a href='#f670' class='c014'><sup>[670]</sup></a> of that State, says:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>“There were 21,000 free Negroes in North Carolina in
1835, 4,000 of whom were entitled then to vote.” After
1835 Negroes were not allowed to vote there again until
after the War.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Constitution of Tennessee<a id='r671' /><a href='#f671' class='c014'><sup>[671]</sup></a> of 1834 provided that
no person should be disqualified from voting in any election
who was then by the laws of the State a competent
witness in a court of justice against a white person. One
cannot tell how many Negroes were qualified to vote
under this provision. The Constitution of Wisconsin<a id='r672' /><a href='#f672' class='c014'><sup>[672]</sup></a>
of 1848 limited the privilege of voting to white persons,
but the Supreme Court<a id='r673' /><a href='#f673' class='c014'><sup>[673]</sup></a> of that State held in
1866 that suffrage had been extended to Negroes by a
vote of the people at the general election on November
6, 1849.</p>

<p class='c007'>Several States which at first allowed Negro freemen
to vote later withdrew the privilege. Until the Revolution,
they were allowed to vote in every State except
Georgia and South Carolina. Between 1792 and 1834,
Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and Kentucky denied the
suffrage to Negroes. As has been seen, North Carolina
permitted a restricted Negro suffrage until 1835. New
Jersey took the suffrage from the Negro in 1807, Connecticut
in 1814, and Pennsylvania in 1838; and Tennessee,
in 1834, limited the right to those Negroes who were
competent as witnesses against white persons. New York,
in 1821, required a very high property qualification not
required of white persons.<a id='r674' /><a href='#f674' class='c014'><sup>[674]</sup></a> Wisconsin alone changed its
law so as to allow Negroes to vote on equality with
white persons. New York tried twice to do so, but failed
each time.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>In each of the acts of territorial government drawn
up by Congress, suffrage was restricted to free white persons.
This fact, together with the fact that the West Virginia
Constitution of 1861–63 also restricted the suffrage
to white persons, tends to show the attitude of the
National Government in the early days toward Negro
suffrage.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SUFFRAGE BETWEEN 1865 AND 1870</h3>

<p class='c012'>In 1865, the only States that permitted Negroes to
vote on the same footing as white persons were Maine,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont,
and Wisconsin. New York and Tennessee permitted a
restricted Negro suffrage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The changes in the suffrage laws between 1865 and
1870 indicate what might have taken place had not the
United States interfered with the Fifteenth Amendment.
The Reconstruction Constitutions<a id='r675' /><a href='#f675' class='c014'><sup>[675]</sup></a> of the Southern States
in 1868 and 1869 extended the suffrage to Negroes.
These Constitutions, however, did not express the will of
the Southern white people at the time in regard to suffrage.
The Constitution of Maryland,<a id='r676' /><a href='#f676' class='c014'><sup>[676]</sup></a> of 1867, permitted
only white persons to vote; and that of Nebraska,<a id='r677' /><a href='#f677' class='c014'><sup>[677]</sup></a> of
1866–67, under which it sought admission to the Union,
did not give the suffrage to Negroes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Negro suffrage was voted down in New York<a id='r678' /><a href='#f678' class='c014'><sup>[678]</sup></a> in
1868, as it had been in 1846 and 1860, by a vote of 282,403
to 249,802. By the act of territorial government of
Colorado, of 1861, suffrage was restricted to white persons.
But an act of the legislature<a id='r679' /><a href='#f679' class='c014'><sup>[679]</sup></a> of that Territory,
enacted in November, 1861, seemed to extend the right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>to vote to Negroes. This was amended,<a id='r680' /><a href='#f680' class='c014'><sup>[680]</sup></a> however, in
1864, by expressly excluding Negroes and mulattoes from
the suffrage. The legislature of Connecticut<a id='r681' /><a href='#f681' class='c014'><sup>[681]</sup></a> of 1865
proposed an amendment to the Constitution whereby Negroes
would be given the right to vote, the same to be
submitted to the people for their ratification. Minnesota<a id='r682' /><a href='#f682' class='c014'><sup>[682]</sup></a>
and Wisconsin,<a id='r683' /><a href='#f683' class='c014'><sup>[683]</sup></a> in 1865, submitted constitutional amendments
providing for Negro suffrage. According to Representative
Hardwick,<a id='r684' /><a href='#f684' class='c014'><sup>[684]</sup></a> of Georgia, “Negro suffrage was
rejected by decisive majorities.” It was after the 1865
Amendment had been defeated at the polls in Wisconsin
that the Supreme Court of that State, as has been seen,
held that Negroes had been given the right to vote by a
law of 1849.</p>

<p class='c007'>The word “white” was stricken from the Constitution
of Iowa<a id='r685' /><a href='#f685' class='c014'><sup>[685]</sup></a> by the legislature of 1867–68, and this
action was ratified by a vote of 105,384 to 81,384. Minnesota<a id='r686' /><a href='#f686' class='c014'><sup>[686]</sup></a>
amended its Constitution in 1868 so as to extend
suffrage to Negroes. On December 30, 1867, the word
“white” was stricken from the election laws of Dakota
Territory.<a id='r687' /><a href='#f687' class='c014'><sup>[687]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On June 8, 1867, Congress passed, over the President’s
veto, a bill first introduced in 1865 establishing Negro
suffrage in the District of Columbia. Before its passage,
provision had been made by Congress to submit the question
to a vote of the people. The extension of suffrage
to Negroes was rejected by a vote of 6,521 to 35 in Washington
City and 812 to 1 in Georgetown. In spite of this
vote the Thirty-ninth Congress ordained Negro suffrage
for the District. After four years, the government of the
District was so changed that suffrage was taken from all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>the residents. In 1866, Congress established Negro suffrage
in all the Territories of the United States.<a id='r688' /><a href='#f688' class='c014'><sup>[688]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The second section of the Fourteenth Amendment,
proposed June 16, 1866, and declared in force June 28,
1868, reads: “Representatives shall be apportioned among
the several States according to their respective numbers,
counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding
Indians not taxed. But when the right to vote
at any election for the choice of electors for President
and Vice-President of the United States, Representatives
in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State,
or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to
any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one
years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in
any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion,
or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall
be reduced in the proportion which the number of such
male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens
twenty-one years of age in such State.” The Amendment
did not prohibit the denial or abridgment of the
right to vote on account of race or color, but provided that,
if such right was denied or abridged, the State must
suffer the consequence of having its representation in Congress
reduced. One feels safe in saying that the purpose
of the National Government in adopting this section of
the Fourteenth Amendment was to induce the States,
particularly the Southern States, to extend suffrage to the
Negro. With the possible exception of Minnesota, no
State appears to have heeded the warning between 1868
and 1870.</p>

<p class='c007'>One cannot say what would have been the result had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>the National Government rested there—whether or not of
their own accord the various States would have extended
the suffrage to Negroes—because, within less than two
years, the Fifteenth Amendment had deprived the States
of any choice in the matter by providing that they <em>must</em>
not deny or abridge the right to vote on account of race
or color.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SUFFRAGE BETWEEN 1870 AND 1890</h3>

<p class='c012'>At the time of the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment,
in 1870, the following States still restricted the suffrage
to white persons: California, Colorado, Connecticut,
Delaware, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan,
Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, and Pennsylvania.
Illinois<a id='r689' /><a href='#f689' class='c014'><sup>[689]</sup></a> adopted a new Constitution in 1870 which
omitted the word “white.” Missouri<a id='r690' /><a href='#f690' class='c014'><sup>[690]</sup></a> amended its Constitution
on November 8, 1870, after the Fifteenth Amendment
went into effect, by erasing the word “white,” and
Virginia,<a id='r691' /><a href='#f691' class='c014'><sup>[691]</sup></a> in its Constitution of 1870, extended the suffrage
to “male citizens.” It is needless to say that all
the Constitutions adopted since 1870 have omitted the
word “white” from the suffrage qualifications, so it is
not worth while to note the various Constitutions and
Amendments that have been adopted since that date.
But in some State Constitutions which have not been
changed within the last forty years, one still finds the
provision that only “white male citizens” are electors.
This is true of Maryland.<a id='r692' /><a href='#f692' class='c014'><sup>[692]</sup></a> Attempts have been made to
amend the Constitution by erasing the word “white,” but
the objection has been made that it is null and void<a id='r693' /><a href='#f693' class='c014'><sup>[693]</sup></a>
anyway by the Fifteenth Amendment, and that it would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>be too expensive to call a constitutional convention or
hold an election solely for the purpose of erasing a
“dead” word.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment—the
opposition it provoked and the means that had
to be adopted to procure its ratification by the Southern
States—is found in the records of Congress, newspapers,
and political discussions of that day. Very little of it has
been preserved in the laws of the States. In the following
resolution by the legislature of Oregon<a id='r694' /><a href='#f694' class='c014'><sup>[694]</sup></a> is found
one of the few traces of the opposition to the Amendment
occurring in the laws of a State outside the
South:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whereas, the State of Oregon was, on the fourteenth
day of February, A.D., 1859, admitted into the Federal
Union, vested with the right to declare what persons
should be entitled to vote within her boundaries; and until
she, by her voluntary act, surrenders that right, the Congress
of the United States has no authority to interfere
with the conditions of suffrage within the boundaries of
the State of Oregon: and</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whereas, the Congress of the United States, by
means of an arbitrary majority of votes acquired by the
power of the bayonet, has sought to force upon the several
States the so-called Fifteenth Amendment to the Federal
Constitution, in direct violation of the terms under which
the State of Oregon was admitted into the Sisterhood of
States; therefore</p>

<p class='c007'>“Be it resolved by the Senate, the House concurring:</p>

<p class='c007'>“That the so-called Fifteenth Amendment is an infringement
upon the popular rights, and a direct falsification
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>of the pledges made to the State of Oregon by the
Federal Government.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Resolved, that the said Fifteenth Amendment be and
the same is hereby rejected.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Resolved, that the Governor be requested to transmit
copies of this resolution to the Secretary of State of the
United States and to the Senators and Representatives
from the State of Oregon in the Congress of the United
States.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The probable explanation of this opposition of Oregon
to the Fifteenth Amendment lies in its unwillingness to
give the ballot to the Japanese, Chinese, and Indians in
the State.</p>

<p class='c007'>The feeling of New York<a id='r695' /><a href='#f695' class='c014'><sup>[695]</sup></a> toward Negro suffrage in
1870 appears to be different from that of Oregon. A
statute was passed prohibiting any registrar or inspector
of elections to demand any oath or ask any questions of
a Negro different from what was demanded of white persons,
or to reject the name of any colored person from
registry except for the same causes as would make it his
duty to reject the name of a white person. The violation
of this statute was a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine
of five hundred dollars and imprisonment for six months.</p>

<p class='c007'>In order to make the prohibitions of the Fifteenth
Amendment effective, on May 31, 1870, two months
after the ratification of the Amendment, Congress passed
an Act,<a id='r696' /><a href='#f696' class='c014'><sup>[696]</sup></a> the first section of which reads: “All citizens
of the United States, who are or shall be otherwise qualified
by law to vote at any election by the people in any
State, Territory, district, county, city, parish, township,
school district, municipality, or other territorial division,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>shall be entitled and allowed to vote at all such elections
without distinction of race, color, or previous condition
of servitude, any constitution, law, custom, usage, or regulation
in any State, Territory, or by or under its authority,
to the contrary notwithstanding.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fourth section of the “Enforcement Act,” as the
Act of 1870 was called, provided for the punishment of
any person who should, by force, bribery, threats, intimidation,
or other unlawful means, hinder, delay, or combine
with others to hinder, delay, prevent, or obstruct any
citizen from doing any act required to be done to qualify
him to vote, or from voting at any election.</p>

<p class='c007'>In 1875, two inspectors of a municipal election in
Kentucky were indicted for refusing to receive and count
the vote of a Negro. The Supreme Court<a id='r697' /><a href='#f697' class='c014'><sup>[697]</sup></a> of the United
States, to which the case came by reason of a division of
opinion of the Circuit Court, held that the Fifteenth
Amendment did not confer the right of suffrage, but
rather invested citizens with the right of exemption from
discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise on
account of their race, color, or previous condition of servitude.
The fourth section of the Act of 1870, by its language,
did not confine its operation to unlawful discrimination
on account of race or color and was, therefore, unconstitutional.
The “Enforcement Act” of 1870, like
the Civil Rights Bill of 1875, failed in its desired effect
because it was too far-reaching in its scope. Had the Act
of 1870 been upheld, the Federal authorities would have
taken complete control of all elections, State as well as
Federal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The years between 1870 and 1890 are known for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>actual race distinctions in suffrage. Between 1870 and
1877, the white people of the South were largely disfranchised,
not because of their race, but because of their
participation in the War. After 1877, the Negroes were
largely disfranchised by unlawful methods adopted by the
white people of the South. If this were a history of the
actual race distinctions in suffrage, it would be necessary
to consider at length the “tissue ballots,” the stuffing of
ballot boxes, the intimidation of Negroes by the Ku Klux
Klan and other bodies of white men, and other election
devices and practices in the South at that time. But this
study, as has been said before, is confined to the race distinctions
<em>in</em> the law, not those <em>in defiance of</em> the law. Out
of all the suffrage irregularities of the period very little
suffrage law was evolved. Few judicial decisions and no
statutes bearing directly on the relation of race to suffrage
have been found.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some cases of intimidation of Negroes at the polls
reached the courts of record. In Lawrence County, Ohio,
in 1870, for instance, two white men by threats of violence
kept three Negroes from voting. One of the white men
was convicted in the Federal court<a id='r698' /><a href='#f698' class='c014'><sup>[698]</sup></a> under the Act of
1870, and imprisoned six months; the other was acquitted
because he had not been heard to use threatening language.
In 1871 a white man in South Carolina was convicted
in the Federal court<a id='r699' /><a href='#f699' class='c014'><sup>[699]</sup></a> for conspiring to keep a
Negro from voting at a congressional election. The same
year, in a contested election for mayor of Leavenworth,
Kansas, the defeated candidate claimed that he would
have been elected had not a number of Negroes been improperly
kept from voting. He did not show that they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>had been in the ward thirty days as required by the election
law of the State, and the court<a id='r700' /><a href='#f700' class='c014'><sup>[700]</sup></a> held that Negroes
must satisfy the same requirements as to residence as
other voters. In a State election in Louisiana, in 1872,
it was claimed, upon the affidavits of four thousand voters,
that the votes of ten thousand Negroes had been suppressed
because of their race and color.<a id='r701' /><a href='#f701' class='c014'><sup>[701]</sup></a> A tax collector
in Delaware, in 1873, refused or failed to collect taxes
from Negroes when the payment of taxes was a prerequisite
to voting. The Federal court<a id='r702' /><a href='#f702' class='c014'><sup>[702]</sup></a> held that it had jurisdiction
because the tax collector was a State officer and,
thus, it was the State denying and abridging the right to
vote on account of race. Over one hundred men were
indicted in the Federal court of Louisiana in 1874 for
intimidating Negroes at the polls.<a id='r703' /><a href='#f703' class='c014'><sup>[703]</sup></a> The same year the
judges of the municipal election of Petersburg, Virginia,
were indicted for refusing to allow a number of Negroes
to vote.<a id='r704' /><a href='#f704' class='c014'><sup>[704]</sup></a> In 1878, a Negro in Illinois who was denied
the right to vote at a school election sued and recovered
a hundred dollars damages.<a id='r705' /><a href='#f705' class='c014'><sup>[705]</sup></a> In Georgia, in 1844, several
white men were convicted in the circuit court of the
United States for intimidating, beating, and maltreating
Negroes to keep them from voting. The Supreme Court<a id='r706' /><a href='#f706' class='c014'><sup>[706]</sup></a>
held that Congress had power to regulate Federal elections
and could prevent such intimidation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It will be noticed that nearly all of the cases cited
above are along the same line—intimidation of Negroes
to keep them from voting. Several constitutional principles,
however, relating to suffrage were evolved out of
the cases decided during this period. In some of these
cases a Negro was not a party at all. It was thought at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>first, for instance, that suffrage was a right of citizenship
and that the Fourteenth Amendment entitled every citizen
to vote. Consequently, a proceeding was started in
the courts of Kentucky in 1874 to establish the right of
a woman to vote. The case went up to the Supreme
Court<a id='r707' /><a href='#f707' class='c014'><sup>[707]</sup></a> of the United States which held that the Constitution
of the United States does not confer the right
of suffrage upon anyone. Next, it was thought that the
Fifteenth Amendment conferred the right to vote upon
Negroes, but the case of United States v. Reese settled
this point by deciding that the Amendment did not confer
upon Negroes the right to vote, but the right not to
be discriminated in voting on account of race, color, or
previous condition of servitude.<a id='r708' /><a href='#f708' class='c014'><sup>[708]</sup></a> Despite the Fourteenth
and Fifteenth Amendments, the principle remains that
the individual States retain the right to prescribe the
qualifications for voting so long as they do not discriminate
against persons on account of race, color, or previous
condition of servitude.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SOUTHERN SUFFRAGE AMENDMENTS SINCE 1890</h3>

<p class='c012'>In 1890, a distinct departure was made in the development
of the law of suffrage. For thirteen years, roughly
speaking, the Negroes had been in a great measure disfranchised
by the illegal means already referred to. According
to the Constitutions and laws of the Southern
States, the Negro had precisely the same right to vote as
the white person. Yet he did not vote, or, if he voted, his
ballot came to naught. The Southern white people, wearied
of using underhand methods of eliminating the effect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>of Negro suffrage, turned to seek a method under the law
to accomplish the same result. The Fifteenth Amendment
seemed to offer an insuperable obstacle. The problem
was how to evade this constitutional provision. Speaking
of this difficulty, the Supreme Court of Mississippi<a id='r709' /><a href='#f709' class='c014'><sup>[709]</sup></a>
said: “Within the field of permissible action under the
limitations proposed by the Federal Constitution, the Convention
[the Constitutional Convention of Mississippi,
1890] swept the field of expedients to obstruct the exercise
of suffrage by the Negro race. By reason of its previous
condition of servitude and dependency, this race had acquired
or accentuated certain peculiarities of habit, or
temperament, and of character, which clearly distinguished
it as a race from the whites. A patient, docile people;
but careless, landless, migratory within certain limits,
without forethought; and its criminal members given to
furtive offences rather than the robust crimes of the
whites. Restrained by the Federal Constitution from discriminating
against the Negro race, the Convention discriminated
against its characteristics and the offences to
which its criminal members are prone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Beginning in 1890 the Southern States have, one by
one, adopted new Constitutions or amended their old ones
so as to change considerably the qualifications of voters.
Suffrage amendments have been adopted by the Southern
States in the following order: Mississippi,<a id='r710' /><a href='#f710' class='c014'><sup>[710]</sup></a> 1890; South
Carolina,<a id='r711' /><a href='#f711' class='c014'><sup>[711]</sup></a> 1895; Louisiana,<a id='r712' /><a href='#f712' class='c014'><sup>[712]</sup></a> 1898; North Carolina,<a id='r713' /><a href='#f713' class='c014'><sup>[713]</sup></a>
1900; Alabama,<a id='r714' /><a href='#f714' class='c014'><sup>[714]</sup></a> 1901; Virginia,<a id='r715' /><a href='#f715' class='c014'><sup>[715]</sup></a> 1901; and Georgia,<a id='r716' /><a href='#f716' class='c014'><sup>[716]</sup></a>
1908. Maryland<a id='r717' /><a href='#f717' class='c014'><sup>[717]</sup></a> has made two separate attempts, one
in 1905 and the other in 1909, to amend its Constitution,
but has failed in both instances. Florida, Arkansas, Tennessee,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>and Texas have not made any constitutional
changes in the matter of suffrage which might be called
“Suffrage Amendments.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The phrase, “the Suffrage Amendments in the South,”
has been used so often that the idea prevails among those
unfamiliar with the laws on the subject that suffrage qualifications
in the Southern States are fundamentally different
from those in other States. With the hope of making
plain wherein suffrage laws in the South are similar
to and wherein they differ from the corresponding laws
of other States, a table of the qualifications of electors
in all the States and Territories of the United States, including
Alaska, Porto Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippines,
is given (see pp. 322–339). The requirements for voters
will be taken in the order given in the tables and considered
with reference to the ways in which they lend themselves
to race distinctions and discriminations.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Citizenship</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>In order to vote, one must be a citizen of the United
States or an alien who has taken the formal step toward
naturalization of declaring his intention to become a citizen,
with the exception that, in a few States, an Indian
who has severed his tribal relationship may vote. This
suffrage qualification does not easily lend itself to race
distinction or discrimination. It lies within the power
of the United States, not of the States, to say what alien
residents may become citizens.<a id='r718' /><a href='#f718' class='c014'><sup>[718]</sup></a> If Congress says, as it
does in the Chinese Exclusion Act,<a id='r719' /><a href='#f719' class='c014'><sup>[719]</sup></a> that Chinese not natives
of this country cannot become citizens, it follows
that they cannot demand of a State the privilege of voting.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>At present, a statute<a id='r720' /><a href='#f720' class='c014'><sup>[720]</sup></a> specially provides for the
naturalization of aliens of African nativity and persons of
African descent, requiring that the same rules shall apply
to them as to free white persons.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only case that has been found involving the citizenship
of a Negro arose in Michigan in 1872.<a id='r721' /><a href='#f721' class='c014'><sup>[721]</sup></a> A Negro,
born in Canada of parents who had been slaves in
Virginia but who had gone to Canada in 1834, went to
Michigan at the age of twenty. The question was whether
he was a citizen of the United States and, so, entitled to
registration as a voter. The Supreme Court of the State
held that, when his parents went to Canada, they were no
longer under the jurisdiction of this country. The son
was not born of citizens of the United States, nor was
he born under the jurisdiction of the United States, and,
therefore, was not a citizen of the United States.</p>

<p class='c007'>The citizenship requirement in the Southern States
is essentially the same as that in other States and cannot
be said, in any way, to involve a race distinction.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Age</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>In all of the States and organized Territories an elector
must be twenty-one years of age or over. In the Philippines
the age limit is twenty-three. There seems to be
no possible race distinction in the age requirement. It
may be that, because of the less careful record of dates of
birth among Negroes, more of that race are unable to
prove that they are twenty-one years old; but this is only
a question of evidence.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>
  <h4 class='c011'><em>Sex</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>All except four of the States limit the suffrage to
males. This requirement cannot possibly involve a race
distinction.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Residence</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>All States and Territories require that the voter shall
have resided for a certain length of time previous to the
election in the particular State or Territory, in the County,
and in the precinct, ward, town, or other political division
in which he offers to vote. The residence in the State
varies from three months to two years, in the County or
its corresponding division from thirty days to one year,
and in the precinct, ward, or town from ten days to one
year. It is noticeable that in the Southern States the
required residence is, as a rule, somewhat longer than in
the other States. Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, North
Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia all require a residence
of two years in the State, while Rhode Island is the
only State outside the South that requires a State residence
of that length. Mississippi is the only State that requires
a voter to be a resident of the precinct one year. Louisiana
requires six months in the precinct, while thirty days
is the favorite residence with the other States.</p>

<p class='c007'>The greater term of residence required in the South
may lend itself to race distinction in case one race is more
migratory than the other. If, for instance, the Negro is
more apt to move about from place to place than the white
person, more Negroes than whites will be unable to satisfy
the residence qualification.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>
  <h4 class='c011'><em>Payment of Taxes</em></h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The following States require the payment of poll taxes
as a prerequisite to voting: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida,
Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.
Of these Alabama, Arkansas, and North Carolina
require the payment of the poll tax for only one year
preceding the election; Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi,
for two years preceding; and Virginia, for three
years preceding the election. Some States require payment
of both property and poll taxes; and some, only the
latter. The law of Delaware is that the voter must have
paid a county tax within two years, assessed six months
before the election, not specifying whether it is a poll
or property tax. Georgia provides that all taxes legally
required since 1877 must have been paid six months before
the election. Pennsylvania requires the payment of
a State or county tax within two years to be assessed two
months and paid one month before the election. South
Carolina demands, not only the payment of the poll tax,
but of all taxes for the preceding year. In the Philippines,
the elector must satisfy other tests or show payment of an
annual tax of fifteen dollars.</p>

<p class='c007'>The payment of taxes as a prerequisite to voting is not
peculiar to the Southern States, such a requirement being
found in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and the Philippines as
well. The poll tax and the requirement of payment for
more than the year next preceding the election are found
mostly in the Southern States. In the Philippines alone,
it appears, the payment of taxes is an alternative requirement;
that is, if one cannot satisfy this qualification, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>may, nevertheless, qualify under other tests; but in the
States, he must not only show his payment of taxes but
be qualified as well in other respects.</p>

<p class='c007'>In two ways this qualification lends itself to race distinctions.
In the first place, if Negroes are more shiftless
and less inclined to pay their taxes than white people,
more of them will be unable to satisfy this test. Secondly,
if they are careless about preserving their tax receipts for
one, two, or three successive years, they will be unable to
prove the payment of taxes and, thereby, be disqualified
to vote.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Ownership of Property</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>The next qualification may be said to be in a sense
peculiar to the Southern States, yet not entirely so. In
Rhode Island, one must own property worth one hundred
and thirty-four dollars on which taxes of the preceding
year have been paid or must pay an annual rental of seven
dollars to be entitled to vote for city councillors and to
vote on questions of finances. In Alaska, to be entitled
to vote in municipal elections, one must be the owner of
substantial property interests in the municipality. In the
Philippines, the voter must be able to satisfy other tests
or else be the owner of property assessed at two hundred
and fifty dollars.</p>

<p class='c007'>The property test in the Southern States is an alternative
of the educational tests. That is, if the applicant
cannot satisfy the educational test but can satisfy the
property test, he may register and vote; or he may do so
if he can satisfy the education but not the property test.
Unless special mention is made at the time, this will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>understood in the following discussion of these two qualifications.
When it is said that such and such property or
educational qualification is required, it is meant only that
it is required in case its alternative cannot be satisfied.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Alabama, the property requirement is that the applicant
for registration be the owner or the husband of the
owner of forty acres of land in the State in which they
reside or of real or personal property worth three hundred
dollars upon which taxes for the preceding year have been
paid. In Georgia the requirement is forty acres of land
in the State or five hundred dollars worth of property in
the State. In Louisiana, the requirement is three hundred
dollars worth of property and payment of the personal
taxes. South Carolina prescribes three hundred dollars
worth of property on which the taxes for the preceding
year have been paid. Of the Southern States which
have altered their suffrage laws since 1890, Mississippi,
North Carolina, and Virginia have not provided any permanent
property test.</p>

<p class='c007'>The property qualifications cause the disfranchisement
of more of one race than of the other only in so far as the
first is more shiftless and more delinquent in the payment
of taxes than the other. If the Negro is given the same
opportunity as the white to acquire property, he has an
equal opportunity to register under the property clause
of the suffrage laws.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Educational Test</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>In no sense is the educational qualification peculiar
to the Southern States. As early as 1855, Connecticut
required of voters ability to read the State Constitution.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>The present requirement, as amended in 1897, is ability
to read the Constitution and statutes of the State in
English. In 1857, Massachusetts added as a prerequisite
to voting ability to read the Constitution of the State in
English and write one’s name. The Constitution of Wyoming
of 1889 provides that the applicant for registration
must be able to read the Constitution of the State. California,
in 1894, required ability to read the Constitution
in English and write one’s name. Similar requirements
were made in Maine in 1893 and in Delaware in 1900. In
the territorial possessions of the United States, a Hawaiian
elector must read, speak, and write English or
Hawaiian, and a Filipino must speak, read, and write
English or Spanish. In the Philippines this qualification
is an alternative of the ownership of property; in Hawaii
and the States mentioned above the educational qualification
is absolute.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Southern States now to be considered, it is to
be remembered that the applicant must satisfy either the
education or the property test, not both. In Alabama he
must be able to read and write the Constitution of the
United States in English unless physically disabled. In
Georgia he must be able to read and write in English the
Constitution of the United States or of Georgia, or if
physically disabled from reading and writing, to “understand
and give a reasonable interpretation” of the Constitution
of the United States or of Georgia, when read to
him. In Louisiana he must be able to read and write and
must make his application for registration in his own
handwriting. Mississippi requires that the applicant must
be able to read or understand or reasonably interpret any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>part of the Constitution of the State. North Carolina
requires ability to read and write the State Constitution
in English; South Carolina requires also an ability to read
and write the Constitution, but does not specify that the
test must be in English. Virginia does not declare that
the applicant must be able to read and write, but requires
him to make his application for registration in his own
handwriting, and prepare and deposit his ballot without
aid. This does not apply to those registering under the
“Grandfather Clause” to be considered later.</p>

<p class='c007'>All States<a id='r722' /><a href='#f722' class='c014'><sup>[722]</sup></a> and Territories, except Georgia, Missouri,
New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, and New
Mexico have adopted a blanket official ballot which is, in
effect, the requirement of an educational qualification for
voting. By this system the State provides a uniform ballot
containing the names of all persons of all parties to
be voted for, and requires the voter to mark and deposit
his own ballot. Where no party emblem—as the elephant,
cock, or anvil—heads the list of candidates of a particular
party, it is wellnigh impossible for one to mark his ballot
properly unless he is able both to read and write.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Southern States are more lenient in their educational
tests than other States in allowing a person otherwise
qualified to vote if he has either education or property;
while in the latter he must have a certain amount
of education no matter how much property he owns.</p>

<p class='c007'>Educational qualifications easily permit race distinctions
in several ways. In the first place, registration officers
may give a difficult passage of the Constitution to a
Negro, and a very easy passage to a white person, or <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice
versa</span></i>. He may permit halting reading by one and require
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>fluent reading by the other. He may let illegible
scratching on paper suffice for the signature of one and
require of the other a legible handwriting. But race discriminations
in such cases rest with the officers; they do
not have their basis in the law itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The educational clause of the proposed Maryland suffrage
amendment, recently defeated at the polls by the
voters of that State, restricted the right to vote to a “person
who, in the presence of the officers of registration,
shall, in his own handwriting, with pen and ink, without
any aid, suggestion, or memorandum whatever addressed
to him by any of the officers of registration, make application
to register correctly, stating in such application his
name, age, date, and place of birth; residence and occupation
at the time and for the two years next preceding;
the name or names of his employer or employers, if any,
at the time and for the two years next preceding; and
whether he has previously voted, and, if so, the State,
county, city, and district, or precinct in which he voted
last. Also the name in full of the President of the United
States, of one of the Justices of the Supreme Court of the
United States, of the Governor of Maryland, of one of the
Judges of the Court of Appeals of Maryland, and of the
Mayor of Baltimore City, if the applicant resides in Baltimore
City, or of one of the County Commissioners of the
County in which the applicant resides.” It is easy to see
how race discriminations could have been made under this
proposed amendment, but it need not be discussed inasmuch
as it failed to become law.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>
  <h4 class='c011'>“<em>Grandfather Clauses</em>”</h4>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The “Grandfather Clauses” are, in a real sense, peculiar
to the Southern States, though there are a few
somewhat similar provisions in other States. For instance,
Illinois, by its Constitution of 1870, allowed those to vote
who had the right to vote on April 1, 1848, provided, of
course, they satisfied the age, sex, and residence qualifications.
When Maine added its educational requirement in
1893, it provided that this qualification should not apply
to anyone who had the right to vote in January, 1893, or
to anyone sixty years of age at that time. Massachusetts
had made a similar provision in 1857. The Constitution
of Wyoming of 1889 had said that nothing in it, except
the provisions about idiots, lunatics, and convicts, should
be construed to deprive any one of the right to vote who
had that right at the time of the adoption of the Constitution.
New Hampshire does not allow paupers to vote,
but it provides that one who served in the Rebellion and
was honorably discharged shall not be disfranchised because
he has received aid from the public. In the Philippines,
one unable to satisfy the educational or property
test, may, nevertheless, vote if he held a substantial office
under the Spanish régime.</p>

<p class='c007'>The principle of the “Grandfather Clause,” in short,
is that one who is not able to satisfy either the educational
or property tests may, nevertheless, continue to be a voter
for life if he was a voter in 1867 or is an old soldier or
the lineal descendant of such voter or soldier, provided he
registers prior to a fixed date. Alabama permits all who
served honorably in the forces of the United States in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>War of 1812, the War with Mexico, any war with Indians,
the War between the States, the War with Spain, or in
the forces of the Confederate States or of the State during
the War between the States and the lawful descendants
of those and all who are of good character and who understand
the duties and obligations of citizens under a republican
form of government, to register before December 20,
1902. The clause in the Georgia Constitution is like that
of Alabama, except that the privilege is extended to veterans
of the Revolutionary War and their descendants,
and the character and understanding clause is permanent.
To take advantage of the “Grandfather Clause” in
Georgia one must register before January 1, 1915. Louisiana
provided that one entitled to vote in any State January
1, 1867, son or grandson of such a one twenty-one
years old or over in 1898, or a foreigner naturalized before
January 1, 1898, who had resided in the State
five years preceding his application for registration, might
register before September 1, 1898. North Carolina allowed
one who had the right to vote on January 1, 1867, and the
lineal descendant of such a one to be registered prior to
December 1, 1908. Before January 1, 1898, one could
register in South Carolina who could read the Constitution
of the State or understand and explain it. In Virginia
one might register up to 1904 who, before 1902,
served in the army or navy of the United States or of the
Confederate States or of Virginia or who was the son of
such a one, or who owned property on which the State tax
was one dollar, or who was able to read and explain or to
understand and explain the Constitution of the State.
Mississippi has no “Grandfather Clause.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>In Alabama, Georgia, and Virginia, the fact that one
was a soldier enabled him to register under the “Grandfather
Clause”; in Louisiana and North Carolina, that
he was a voter in 1867. In each State the lineal descendants
of such soldiers or voters in 1867 might register under
the “Grandfather Clause.” In Alabama one might
register, though he was not an old soldier or descendant
of one, if he understood the duties and obligations of citizenship
and was of good character. In Virginia and
South Carolina, one could register under the “Grandfather
Clause” if he could understand and explain the
Constitution when read to him; and, in Virginia, if he
owned property taxed as much as one dollar a year.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Grandfather Clauses” are all temporary. Those
classes of men covered by the clauses are given a certain
time within which to have their names entered on a permanent
registry. If they are once entered on the permanent
register, they are voters for life unless excluded because
of some crime or because they become public charges.
If they fail, however, to register within the limited time,
and still wish to become electors, they must satisfy the
same tests as other applicants for registration. For instance,
one who could vote in North Carolina in 1867
might have his name entered on the permanent register
prior to December 1, 1908, and thereby become a voter
for life, though he had neither property nor literacy; if
he failed to register by that date, he had to satisfy the
educational test as any other applicant would have to do.
The length of duration of the “Grandfather Clauses”
varies from a few months to several years. Thus, the
“Grandfather Clause” of South Carolina was of avail
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>from 1895 to 1898; of Louisiana, from May 16, 1898, to
September 1, 1898; of North Carolina, from July 1, 1900,
to December 1, 1908; of Alabama, from 1901 to 1903;
Virginia, from 1902 to 1904; and in Georgia, it extends
from 1908 to 1915. It will be seen that Georgia is the
only State in which the “Grandfather Clause” is still in
force. All who registered within the dates given above
are still electors and will continue to be as long as they
live unless excluded from the suffrage because of crime
or the like; those who have not registered under the
“Grandfather Clauses” cannot do so now, except in
Georgia.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Grandfather Clauses” are more nearly race distinctions
than any other sections of the suffrage laws for
the reason that so many white men in the Southern States
and so few Negroes are either old soldiers or descendants
of old soldiers or had the right to vote in 1867. Yet they
are not, technically speaking, race distinctions because, if
one was a veteran or son of one, he might register regardless
of his race or color. As a matter of fact, a considerable
number of Negroes in the Southern States, who
were Federal soldiers in the Civil War, have registered
under the “Grandfather Clauses.”</p>

<h4 class='c011'>“<em>Understanding and Character Clauses</em>”</h4>

<p class='c012'>The “Understanding Clauses” do not have as large
a place in the suffrage laws of the Southern States as is
commonly believed. In only two States—Georgia and
Mississippi—is the “Understanding Clause” permanent.
In Georgia, one may register if he is of good character and
understands the duties and obligations of citizens under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>a republican form of government, although he has neither
education nor property. In Mississippi, one who cannot
read may register if he can understand and reasonably interpret
the Constitution when read to him. A distinction
must be made between these two “Understanding
Clauses.” In Georgia the requirement is the understanding
of the duties of citizens of a republican form of government;
in Mississippi it is understanding the State Constitution
when read. In three other States—Alabama, South
Carolina, and Virginia—the “Understanding Clause” of
the Mississippi type is part of the “Grandfather” section,
and became inoperative with the “Grandfather Clauses.”
The Georgia provision which allows one to register, regardless
of education or property, if he is of good moral
character has a prototype in the Constitution of Connecticut
which requires all electors to be of good moral
character, and the Constitution of Vermont which requires
the electors to be of quiet and peaceable behavior.</p>

<p class='c007'>It cannot be doubted that the permanent “Understanding
Clauses” of Mississippi and Georgia lend themselves
to race discrimination. The Constitution of Mississippi
provides that the applicant for registration must
be able either to read or understand and reasonably interpret
the Constitution. The registrar who so desires
may easily disqualify members of one race by asking them
to explain more difficult passages of the Constitution or
by requiring of them a more scholarly interpretation of
such passages than he demands of members of the other
race whom he desires to have qualify as electors. In
Georgia the registrar who passes upon an applicant’s understanding
of the duties and obligations of citizens under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>a republican form of government may set a higher standard
for one race than for the other.</p>

<h4 class='c011'><em>Persons Excluded from Suffrage</em></h4>

<p class='c012'>Certain classes of persons are excluded from the franchise
because they are considered incapable or unfit to take
a hand in governmental matters. The classes excluded
are practically the same in all the States, and there is
slight evidence of any race distinction in such cases. The
following States do not allow paupers to vote: Delaware,
Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey,
Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and West
Virginia. Other States, including Louisiana, Missouri,
Montana, Oklahoma, and South Carolina, exclude the inmates
of public institutions of charity, Louisiana and Oklahoma
making an exception of Soldiers’ Homes. Practically
all the States exclude idiots and insane persons
from the suffrage. Other classes, though not excluded
from the suffrage, are not allowed to get the required
residence to become electors. Thus, in a number of States,
students in schools, unless self-supporting, do not get the
required residence by living at the school. In a great
majority of the States, soldiers and sailors in service do not
gain an electoral residence in a State, county, or precinct
by being stationed therein. California, Idaho, Nevada,
and Oregon exclude all but American-born Chinese.
Where the Chinese, because of the Federal naturalization
laws, are incapable of becoming citizens, they cannot be
electors, because all the States require the electors to be
either citizens or persons who have formally declared
their intention to become citizens. Idaho, Maine, Michigan,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>Minnesota, Mississippi, North Dakota, Oklahoma,
Washington, and Wisconsin exclude tribal Indians, or,
what is perhaps the same, Indians not taxed.</p>

<p class='c007'>All States exclude from the suffrage those who have
been convicted of certain crimes; that is, those who may
have served out their terms of imprisonment, but who
have not been restored to their civil rights by the executive
department of the State. Treason and felonies like
embezzlement and bribery are the crimes most frequently
mentioned. One finds here a possible race distinction.
The Southern States have greatly added to the list of
crimes which operate as an exclusion from the suffrage.
By the Constitution of Alabama of 1875, for instance, the
following were excluded from suffrage: Those convicted
of treason, embezzlement of public funds, malfeasance in
office, larceny, bribery, or any other crime punishable by
imprisonment in the penitentiary. The last Constitution
of Alabama is more specific; it mentions the following
crimes as having the effect of excluding from the suffrage
those convicted of them: Treason, murder, arson, embezzlement,
malfeasance in office, larceny, receiving stolen
property, obtaining property or money under false pretenses,
perjury, subornation of perjury, robbery, assault
with intent to rob, burglary, forgery, bribery, assault and
battery on wife, bigamy, living in adultery, sodomy, incest,
rape, miscegenation, crime against nature, or any
crime punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary,
or of any infamous crime or crimes involving moral turpitude;
also any person who shall be convicted as a vagrant
or tramp, or of selling or offering to sell his vote or the
vote of another, or of making or offering to make false
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>return in any election by the people or in any primary
election to procure the nomination or election of any
person to any office, or of suborning any witness or registrar
to secure the registration of any person as an elector.
Delaware and several other States, on the other hand,
exclude only those who have been convicted of a felony.
If, as the Supreme Court of Mississippi said, the Negro
is more given to furtive offences than to the robust crimes
of the whites, the exclusions of the Alabama law would
seem to be directed toward these offences. If more Negroes
than whites are guilty of such crimes as larceny and
wife-beating, and of sexual irregularities, then the law
operates to disqualify for the suffrage more Negroes than
whites.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SUFFRAGE IN INSULAR POSSESSIONS OF UNITED STATES</h3>

<p class='c012'>The suffrage qualifications in the insular possessions
of the United States are particularly significant in that
they tend to show the present attitude of Congress toward
the elective franchise. The Act of April 30, 1900, providing
a government for the Territory of Hawaii, restricts
suffrage to those who can speak, read, and write the English
or Hawaiian language—a strict educational test. In
the Philippines to be an elector one must be a native of
the Philippines, twenty-three years of age or over, and
must have paid an annual tax of fifteen dollars, or be the
owner of property assessed at two hundred and fifty dollars,
or be able to speak, read, and write English or Spanish,
or have held substantial office under the Spanish
régime. It will be noticed that the tax payment, educational,
property, and office-holding tests are alternatives,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>so the satisfaction of any one of the four is sufficient.
Manhood suffrage, as provided by the “Foraker Act”<a id='r723' /><a href='#f723' class='c014'><sup>[723]</sup></a>
of 1900, is still in force in Porto Rico. But this seems
destined soon to give way to a restricted suffrage. Secretary
of War Dickinson has recently issued a report on the
conditions in Porto Rico in which he suggests an amendment
of the suffrage laws to the effect that, after the general
election of 1910, the qualified voters for any election
shall consist only of citizens of the United States, who,
with such other qualifications as are required by the laws
of Porto Rico, “are able to read and write; or on the
day of registration shall own taxable real estate in their
own right and name; or who are on said day <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</span></i>
members of a firm or corporation which shall own taxable
real estate in the name of such firm or corporation; or
on the day of registration shall possess and produce to
the Board of Registration tax receipts showing the payment
of any kind of taxes for the last six months of the
year in which the election is held.” President Taft, in
transmitting the report to Congress, indorsed Secretary
Dickinson’s suggestions, saying<a href='#f723' class='c014'><sup>[723]</sup></a>: “It is much better in
the interests of the people of the island that the suffrage
should be limited by an educational and property qualification.”
The above suffrage qualifications for the insular
possessions of the United States is evidence that the attitude
of Congress toward universal suffrage has been considerably
modified within recent years.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>CONSTITUTIONALITY OF SUFFRAGE AMENDMENTS</h3>

<p class='c012'>The first “Suffrage Amendment” of the Southern
States, that of Mississippi, was adopted twenty years ago,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>and yet no case involving the constitutionality of these
laws has been squarely presented to the Supreme Court
of the United States. The one most nearly in point was
Williams v. Mississippi<a id='r724' /><a href='#f724' class='c014'><sup>[724]</sup></a> in 1898. Williams, a Negro,
had been indicted by a jury composed wholly of white men.
The law required that a juror should be an elector. Williams
contended that the provisions of the Constitution
about suffrage were a scheme to discriminate against Negroes,
that the discrimination was effected, not by the
wording of the law, but by the powers vested in the administrative
officers. The United States Supreme Court refused
to interfere, saying that the laws did not, on their
face, discriminate against the races, and that it “had not
been shown that their actual administration was evil, only
that evil was possible under them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Several suits<a id='r725' /><a href='#f725' class='c014'><sup>[725]</sup></a> have been brought, the purpose of
which has been to test the constitutionality of these laws,
but they have all been decided on points of procedure or
on technical grounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>At present, the suffrage laws of the Southern States
stand judicially unimpugned in the light of the Fifteenth
Amendment. Mr. John Mabry Mathews<a id='r726' /><a href='#f726' class='c014'><sup>[726]</sup></a> says that
the Supreme Court has shown an “apparent desire to
shift the duty of redressing such wrongs [those arising
under the suffrage laws] upon the political department of
the Government. So far as Congress has given any indication
of its attitude upon the subject, it has intimated
that the matter is one for judicial settlement. But the
absence of congressional legislation would in any case
hamper the efficiency of the courts in securing the practical
enforcement of the Amendment. The real reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>behind the attitude of both Congress and the courts is the
apathetic tone of public opinion, which is the final arbiter
of the question. In the technical sense, the Amendment
is still a part of the supreme law of the land. But as a
phenomenon of the social consciousness, a rule of conduct,
no matter how authoritatively promulgated by the nation,
if not supported by the force of public opinion, is already
in process of repeal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It cannot be safely conjectured what the Supreme
Court will say when it squarely faces the suffrage laws of
the South in their relation to the Fifteenth Amendment.
Until then, each is entitled to his opinion. That the citizenship,
age, sex, and residence qualifications are in perfect
conformity to the Amendment there is no doubt. The
qualifications of tax payment, property, and education
existed long before the Fifteenth Amendment in the
States of the men most active in securing the adoption of
that Amendment. It is hardly to be supposed that the
Senators and Representatives from Massachusetts and
Pennsylvania understood the Amendment they were advocating
to be nullifying the suffrage laws of their respective
States. Moreover, a property or educational test is not an
abridgment or denial of the right to vote, because it lies
within the power of everyone, regardless of race, to accumulate
property and acquire literacy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The “Grandfather Clauses” are the most doubtful
parts of the suffrage laws. In one sense, they are not at
all a denial or an abridgment of the right to vote. Granting
that the property and educational tests are constitutional,
the “Grandfather Clause,” instead of abridging or
denying, enlarges the right to vote by giving the suffrage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>to those who would be disqualified under the property or
educational tests. Be that as it may, the Southern States
are more uneasy about the constitutionality of these provisions
than of any others. For instance, at the last two
sessions of the legislature of North Carolina bills were
introduced to extend the “Grandfather Clause” of that
State to 1812 and 1816 respectively. In each case the bill
was defeated, the argument against it being that it was
unwise to open up the suffrage question again, lest the
amendment be brought into court.<a id='r727' /><a href='#f727' class='c014'><sup>[727]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A leading thinker on constitutional law has given the
unpublished opinion that the “Grandfather Clauses” are
in violation of the tenth section of the first article of the
Constitution of the United States, which says that no State
shall grant any title of nobility. His idea is that an order
of nobility is created whenever a class of persons is
granted exceptional political privileges, that the old soldiers
and lineal descendants constitute such a class, and
that the title of nobility is “Elector,” whether expressed
or not.</p>

<p class='c007'>If the “Grandfather Clause” should be declared unconstitutional
on the ground just suggested or on any
other ground, the next question would be whether that
would nullify the other sections of the suffrage laws, such
as the educational and property tests. This depends upon
whether the different sections of the laws are separable,
whether the legislature or the people would have adopted
the educational and property tests, etc., if they had thought
the “Grandfather Clause” unenforceable.<a id='r728' /><a href='#f728' class='c014'><sup>[728]</sup></a> North Carolina
prepared for just such a contingency by inserting the
following section in its Suffrage Amendment: “That this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>amendment to the Constitution is presented and adopted
as one indivisible plan for the regulation of the suffrage,
with the intent and purpose to so connect the different
parts, and to make them so dependent upon each other
that the whole shall stand or fall together.”</p>

<h3 class='c013'>MARYLAND AND FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT</h3>

<p class='c012'>In the preceding section it has been assumed that the
Fifteenth Amendment is an integral part of the Constitution
of the United States. Whether or not this assumption
is warranted is brought into question by a recent action of
the legislature of Maryland.</p>

<p class='c007'>As has been said earlier in this chapter, Maryland has
made two unsuccessful attempts to amend its suffrage laws
in such a way as would disfranchise a large number of the
present Negro voters in that State. The letter of the
Constitution of Maryland at present restricts suffrage to
<em>white</em> male citizens; but it has been taken for granted that
the word “white” became inoperative under the Fifteenth
Amendment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Out of the discussion of Negro suffrage in Maryland
has arisen the question whether or not the Fifteenth
Amendment itself is valid. At the last session of the
legislature of that State, that of 1910, the so-called Digges
Bills were introduced and passed by both houses. The
purpose of these bills was to disfranchise all Negroes who
have not owned five hundred dollars’ worth of property for
two years before their application for registration, upon
which all taxes have been paid during those two years.
This disfranchisement applied only to State and municipal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>elections. The bills failed to become laws only because
they were vetoed by the Governor of the State.</p>

<p class='c007'>Upon the failure of the Digges Bills to be passed, a
constitutional amendment<a id='r729' /><a href='#f729' class='c014'><sup>[729]</sup></a> was drafted and approved by
the required three-fifths of all the members of both houses
of the legislature, which embodied the same features as
the Digges Bills. This amendment is to be voted upon by
the people at the general election in November, 1911.
This amendment provides for the Australian ballot and
for uniform election laws throughout the State. In the
event of the amendment being declared unconstitutional,
the laws now in force in Maryland are to be revived
automatically.</p>

<p class='c007'>The validity of the proposed Maryland amendment is
directly dependent upon the invalidity of the Fifteenth
Amendment. Under the proposed amendment, no property
qualification whatever is required of <em>white</em> male citizens
applying for registration, while a heavy property
qualification is required of <em>every other</em> male citizen—and
this must include Negroes—applying for registration.
Thus, in violation of the Fifteenth Amendment, the right
of citizens of the United States to vote would be denied or
abridged by the State of Maryland on account of race or
color.</p>

<p class='c007'>The validity of the Fifteenth Amendment is questioned
on the following grounds, among others: (1) The fifth
article of the Federal Constitution provides that Congress,
“whenever two-thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary,”
shall propose amendments to the Constitution. It
is claimed that only thirty-nine of the sixty-six members
of the Senate, less than two-thirds, voted to submit the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>Fifteenth Amendment to the States for their ratification.
(2) Maryland was one of the two States—the other being
Delaware—that refused to ratify either the Thirteenth,
Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment. It is claimed,
therefore, that Maryland is not bound by the Fifteenth
Amendment, which it did not ratify. (3) The fifth
article of the Constitution, after providing the two ways
in which the Constitution may be amended, adds that “no
State, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal
suffrage in the Senate.” Upon this last clause, Mr.
Arthur W. Machen, Jr., in a recent article in <cite>The Harvard
Law Review</cite>,<a id='r730' /><a href='#f730' class='c014'><sup>[730]</sup></a> has founded an ingenious argument that
the Fifteenth Amendment is void. His reasoning on this
point is, in brief, that the State meant here is the citizens
or voters or the government of the State, and not the
territory. By the enfranchisement of the Negroes after the
War, the composition of the State was changed, a body of
persons became part of the State who were not a part of
it before, and thus the State was deprived of its equal
suffrage in the Senate. Mr. Machen says: “The Fifteenth
Amendment amounts to a compulsory annexation to each
State that refused to ratify it of a black San Domingo
within its borders. It is no less objectionable than the
annexation of the San Domingo in the Spanish main.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Whether or not any or all of the above objections and
the others that are urged against the Fifteenth Amendment
are valid cannot now be answered, because the validity
of the Amendment has been assumed by the courts
rather than decided upon after argument. Until after the
election of November, 1911, attention will be centered
upon Maryland. If the proposed amendment to the State
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>Constitution is ratified by the people, then haste will no
doubt be made to have its constitutionality tested, in which
case the validity of the Fifteenth Amendment will be
directly raised. The Southern States, as a rule, deplore
this action on the part of Maryland because they fear that
it will open up the whole suffrage question. It is deplored
by people over the country as a whole because they fear
that it will revive the ill feeling among the sections occasioned
by Reconstruction.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>EXTENT OF ACTUAL DISFRANCHISEMENT</h3>

<p class='c012'>It is impossible to say how many persons have been
disfranchised under the suffrage laws. No doubt many
who are capable of satisfying the qualifications do not
register, or, if they register, do not vote. This is probably
due to the one-party system in the South. The following
figures show either the extent of actual disfranchisement
or the political apathy in the Southern States: In one
county in Mississippi, with a population of about 8,000
whites and 11,700 Negroes in 1900, there were only twenty-five
or thirty qualified Negro voters in 1908, the rest
being disqualified, it is said, on the educational test. In
another county, with 30,000 Negroes, only about 175 were
registered voters. In still another county of Mississippi,
with 8,000 whites and 12,000 Negroes, only 400 white men
and about 30 Negroes are qualified electors. The clerk of
court of a county in North Carolina, with a population of
5,700 whites and 6,700 Negroes, writes that a Negro has
never voted in the County. As a general rule, taking the
country at large, about one person in five is a male of voting
age. In Iowa four out of five possible voters have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>actually voted in the last four elections; in Georgia, a
State of nearly the same population, the proportion is
one to six. In Mississippi, in 1906, only one out of
eighteen males of voting age actually voted; in Georgia,
one out of fifteen. In a district in Mississippi with a
population of 190,885, 2,091 votes were cast for the Representative,
John Sharp Williams, in 1906; in a district
in Connecticut with a population of 247,875, 46,425 votes
were cast for Representative Litchfield. These figures
show that the ratio of actual voters to total population in
the Southern States is astoundingly smaller than in other
States.<a id='r731' /><a href='#f731' class='c014'><sup>[731]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c012'><a href='#r661'>661</a>. The following table, giving the dates of the Constitutions
of the various States and the Organic Laws of the Territories
with the sections referring to suffrage, up to and
including 1865, indicates the extent to which suffrage was
restricted to white people before and at that date. “White,”
“white freeman,” “free white,” etc., mean that only white
persons or white freemen or free white persons had the
elective franchise. Where the suffrage is given to male
“citizens” or “inhabitants” whether Negroes were included
depends upon whether they were treated in those States as
“citizens” or “inhabitants.”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <span class='large'>RACE DISTINCTIONS <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la">VERSUS</span></i> RACE DISCRIMINATIONS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Heretofore, the writer has let the legislatures and
courts speak for themselves, withholding personal opinions
and refraining from making deductions from the
facts revealed. Now, however, that the various race distinctions
have been reviewed at some length, it may be
worth while to consider what conclusions the facts warrant
and what practical lessons they suggest.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>RACE DISTINCTIONS NOT CONFINED TO ONE SECTION</h3>

<p class='c012'>Race distinctions are not confined to any one section
of the country. This conclusion is the most patent of all.
There is scarcely a State or Territory in the Union where
legislative or judicial records do not reveal the actual existence
of at least some race distinctions. Of the twenty-six
States and Territories that prohibit intermarriage,
more than half, extending from Delaware to Oregon, are
outside the South. Negroes have, on account of their
race, been excluded, usually contrary to the local laws,
from hotels in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New
York, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, and Iowa; from barber-shops,
in Nebraska and Connecticut; from bootblack
stands, in New York; from billiard-rooms, in Massachusetts;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>from saloons, in Minnesota and Ohio; from soda
fountains, in Illinois; from theatres, in Illinois and New
York; from skating rinks in New York and Iowa; and the
bodies of Negroes have been refused burial with those of
white persons in Pennsylvania. It is not meant here that
Negroes are always excluded from such places in these
States, but that instances of such exclusions are found in
the laws. Most of the States have at one time or another
made distinctions between the races in schools. California
and other States of the Far West are demanding separate
schools for Japanese. Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and
Iowa, besides other States of the Middle West, clash from
time to time with their school boards for attempting to
separate the races in schools. Delaware is diligent in providing
separate schools for white persons and Negroes.
In Massachusetts, until 1857, the school board of Boston
provided a separate school for Negroes in that city. As to
public conveyances, the term “Jim Crow,” applied to a car
set apart for Negroes, was first used in Massachusetts, and
it was in Pennsylvania that the first leading case involving
the right of street car companies to separate their passengers
by race arose. Instances of actual discrimination
against Negroes by common carriers were found in Illinois,
Iowa, and California. How common race distinctions
are in the States mentioned the above resumé does
not clearly show, because the great majority of grievances
caused by race distinctions do not reach the court. But
when one finds that the legislature has deemed it advisable
to enact a law against race distinctions, it is reasonable
to assume that they did in fact exist. For instance, five
States, all outside the South, prohibit discriminations by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>insurance companies on account of race. Had these companies
not evinced signs of discrimination against Negroes,
such statutes would not have been enacted. It is
well known that race distinctions are common in the
South.</p>

<p class='c007'>Were this general prevalence of race distinctions fully
realized, the result would be a kindlier feeling one to
another among the white people of the various sections.
They would then see that the presence or absence of race
distinctions is due, not to any inherent difference in the
character of the people, but to diverse conditions and environment.
When, therefore, the Negro children of Upper
Alton, Illinois, are seen to constitute an appreciable
percentage of the school population, the people of that
town, as the people of a Southern town would do under
similar circumstances, demand for them a separate
school.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>RACE DISTINCTIONS NOT CONFINED TO ONE RACE</h3>

<p class='c012'>Race distinctions are not confined to any one race.
It is true that most of the statutes and judicial decisions
above referred to relate to the Negro because he belongs
to a race which is the largest non-Caucasian element in
the United States. Where, however, other race elements
exist in considerable numbers, similar distinctions are
sanctioned. One finds, for instance, in California and
other States of the Far West, where Japanese are numerous,
laws prohibiting intermarriage between Mongolians
and Caucasians, and requiring separate schools for the
two races. Similar laws have been enacted wherever there
is an appreciable number of Indians. Wherever, in other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>words, any two races have lived together in this country
in anything like equal numbers, race distinctions have
been recognized in the law sooner or later; and, before
becoming legally recognized, have existed in practice.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>RACE DISTINCTIONS NOT DECREASING</h3>

<p class='c012'>Race distinctions do not appear to be decreasing. On
the contrary, distinctions heretofore existing only in custom
tend to crystallize into law. As a matter of fact,
most of the distinctions which are described above as the
“Black Laws of 1865–68” are no longer in force. No
State now carries statutes prescribing the hour when a
Negro laborer must arise, requiring his contracts to be in
writing, prohibiting him from leaving the plantation or
receiving visitors without his employer’s consent, or exacting
a license fee of him before he can engage in certain
trades. These laws were vestiges of the slave system and
survived but a short time after that system had been abolished.
Likewise, those statutes which prohibited Negroes
from testifying in court against white persons were repealed
during the first few years after Emancipation. But
distinctions which are not the direct results of slavery
have found an increasing recognition in the law. Thus,
though Florida, Mississippi, and Texas had separate railroad
coaches for freedmen in 1866, the regular “Jim
Crow” laws did not begin to creep into the statutes of the
Southern States till 1881. Now every Southern State,
except Missouri, has a law separating the races in railroad
cars. Mississippi, in 1888, was the first State to
require separate waiting-rooms. Louisiana, in 1902, took
the lead in compelling separate street car accommodations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>being followed by most of the Southern States within the
last seven years.</p>

<p class='c007'>A similar tendency toward crystallization of race distinctions
into law is found in schools. Though Massachusetts
permitted separate schools as early as 1800, and
though the Southern States required them from the beginning
of their public school system, it is only recently
that any States have seen fit to create distinctions in private
schools by legislation. At present, Florida, Kentucky,
Oklahoma, and Tennessee prohibit the teaching of
white and Negro students in the same private schools, and
their action in so doing the Supreme Court of the United
States in the Berea College case has decided to be constitutional.
Moreover, the Japanese school question of the
West has become of national concern only within the last
two years.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the matter of suffrage also one observes the same
general trend of practices slowly passing into statutes.
Between 1877 and 1890 Negroes in the South were disfranchised
to a great extent in defiance of law. Beginning
with Mississippi in 1890 and ending with Georgia in
1908, seven Southern States have made constitutional provisions
which, though not in letter creating race distinctions,
lend themselves to race discriminations.</p>

<p class='c007'>That actual race distinctions still persist outside the
South is shown by recent decisions. For instance, within
a year, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of
New York, in reducing damages awarded in the court
below to a Negro porter for false imprisonment, held that
by reason of his race, he did not suffer as much damage
as would a white man under like circumstances. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>New York <cite>Times</cite> of November 19, 1909, refers to a
recent decision of the Supreme Court of Iowa as holding
that a coffee company licensed under the State laws, being
a private concern, has the right to refuse to serve a Negro.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps, as a whole, actual race distinctions in the
United States are not increasing; but distinctions, formerly
sanctioned only by custom, are now either permitted or
required by law, and the number of recent suits in States
outside the South indicates that actual discriminations are
as prevalent as they have been at any time since 1865.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>DISTINCTIONS NOT BASED ON RACE SUPERIORITY</h3>

<p class='c012'>What is the fundamental cause of race distinctions?
No comparison of laws can formulate an answer to that
question; but the personal observation of the writer leads
to the belief that race distinctions are not based fundamentally
upon the feeling by one race of superiority to the
other, but are rather the outgrowth of race consciousness.
If Negroes were in every way equally advanced with white
people, race distinctions would probably be even more
pronounced than now; because, in addition to physical
differentiation, there would be the rivalry of equally
matched races. Thus, the widespread prejudice entertained
by Gentiles toward Jews, resulting in actual, if
not legal, distinctions, is due, not to any notion that Jews
are intellectually or morally inferior to any people, but
to a race consciousness which each possesses. The exclusion
of the Japanese was due, not so much to an intellectual
or moral inferiority of that race to the white race,
as to a difference in their racial ideals. So long as two
races living side by side have each an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour propre</span></i>, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>more numerous may be expected to prescribe distinctions
to which the less numerous must submit; that is, until the
spirit of universal brotherhood is a more compelling force
than it is at present.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SOLUTION OF RACE PROBLEM HINDERED BY MULTIPLICITY OF PROPOSED REMEDIES</h3>

<p class='c012'>If the above generalizations are correct, they should
enable one to draw some practical conclusions for dealing
with race problems. The proper adjustment of race
relations is being retarded by the multiplicity of suggested
solutions, many of them conflicting and thus hindering
one another, some of them parallel and necessarily duplicating
expenditure of energy. For instance, some men,
including both Negroes and white persons, believe that
the proper solution of the race problem is the deportation
of the Negro race; others, that it is the segregation of that
race in some portion of the United States or colonization
in some territorial possession; while others believe that
the South should remain the permanent home of the majority
of Negroes. Advocates of territorial separation of
one sort or another think that efforts should be directed
toward getting the Negro to his new home as soon as possible.
Those who believe that the home of the Negro will
remain in this country are divided upon the steps to be
taken. Some of this class approve of further education
of the Negro, being divided, however, into two overlapping
groups, the one emphasizing literary training, and the
other industrial. Others of this class maintain that any
sort of systematic education of the Negro is only hastening
an inevitable race conflict. In the midst of these conflicting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>opinions, the Negro problem, instead of reaching
a complete or even partial solution, is only being
aggravated.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no need of prophesying what the final solution
will be, but one is justified in believing that the inevitable
changes will be gradual. Whether or not the final
adjustment is a segregation of the Negro race, one can
hardly expect it to come in one, two, or even six decades.
A century hence the white people will probably be living
side by side with Negroes as they do now. The duty
of the American people is to act properly toward all races
in their own lifetime: the far future will take care of
itself. The difficult thing to ascertain is the proper mode
of acting to-day. The solution of the race problem, when
it does come, will doubtless be a composite result. The
race relations are not the same in different sections of
the country or in different States of the South or even
in different counties of the same State. Though the
proper steps now to be taken in the various sections or
States or counties may be different, there can, in the nature
of things, be but one best mode of action for each
community. That must be one for which all people, regardless
of race or section, may profitably strive.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>SEARCH FOR A COMMON PLATFORM</h3>

<p class='c012'>A noticeable effort has been made during the past few
years by students of race relations to construct a platform
upon which all men of every race may stand and work
together for the permanent settlement of all racial antagonisms.
This is evidenced by the organization of late
years of national movements which have enlisted the support
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>of men of different sections and races. One of these,
the Southern Education Association, has been promoted
by men from the North and East as well as by men from
the South, by both Negroes and white people. Soon after
the Atlanta riots of two years ago, a conference of Southern
white men and Negroes was held at Atlanta, for the
purpose of promoting harmony between the races in the
South. Within a few months a conference of Northern and
Southern white men has met in Washington City to consider
the Negro problem. Still more recently a group of
Southern students in Harvard University, realizing that
the race relations were different in different localities of
the South, have organized an informal club to study the
practical problems arising out of the presence of the
Negro in the South and to exchange ideas formed from
observation and experience in their respective localities.
There are other indications of a desire to work out a common
set of principles by which everyone may be governed.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>PROPER PLACE OF RACE DISTINCTIONS</h3>

<p class='c012'>Assuming that it is possible to formulate a platform
deserving the approval of all races, it is appropriate for a
student of any phase of race relations to suggest a plank
for it. A student in the special field of race distinctions in
American law may endeavor to show the place that such
legal distinctions properly hold, bearing in mind all the
while that the whole issue springs out of race consciousness
as it actually exists to-day, not as it should be or as
it may be in the distant future.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let one imagine the existence of a Federal statute—waiving
the question of its constitutionality—prohibiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>States from legalizing race distinctions, so that all public
places of amusement, accommodation, and instruction
would be, so far as the law could make them, open to all
persons, regardless of race. Such a measure, far from
effecting its purpose, would doubtless be the beginning of
extensive race discriminations. Once abolish separate hotel
accommodations and the white race, wherever it is in
the majority, would monopolize every hotel, leaving other
races either to walk the streets or to find accommodations
in private houses. Were separate street car accommodations
forbidden in cities where there is a fairly large percentage
of Negroes, if any passenger were forced to stand
or be crowded off the car altogether, it would be the Negro.
Were separate schools not permitted, Negro children might
possibly be excluded from schools altogether in defiance
of the law; but even if admitted, their interests, if different
from those of the more numerous race, would have
to be sacrificed. A further review of race distinctions
now legally recognized would only more fully substantiate
the conclusion that, with race feeling as it is, if such distinctions
were not recognized and enforced, the stronger
race would naturally appropriate the best for itself and
leave the weaker race to fare as it could.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, let one imagine that the same laws
recognizing race distinctions as now exist in the South
obtained in all communities where two races are nearly
equal in numbers. Suppose, for instance, that separate
hotels were permitted in all cities which receive an appreciable
number of Negro travelers. Respectable Negroes
might then secure comfortable entertainment in hotels
provided for their race and thus escape the inconvenience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>and humiliation of being denied admission to hotels maintained
exclusively for white persons. If separate schools
were provided, Negro children would be free to pursue,
unhampered by requirements prescribed for the more developed
race and unembittered by continuous manifestations
of race prejudice, a curriculum especially adapted
to their own needs. Wherever separate railroad and street
car accommodations were provided, a Negro might enter
the car or compartment reserved for his race and go his
way in peace, unmolested by the thoughtless or vicious of
the other race. The result, therefore, of the honest enforcement
of race distinctions would be to the advantage
of the weaker race.</p>

<h3 class='c013'>OBLITERATION OF RACE DISCRIMINATIONS</h3>

<p class='c012'>The people of the different sections and races, instead
of inquiring into the truth or falsity of such a conclusion,
have been agitating the theoretical right and wrong of
race distinctions. Meanwhile, indications are that legalized
race distinctions have been unfairly enforced. For
instance, statutes require that equal accommodations be
given Negro passengers in public conveyances; yet, while
people have been debating the constitutionality and justification
of the “Jim Crow” laws, railroad companies have
been compelling Negroes to occupy uncomfortable and unsanitary
coaches and waiting-rooms, and this though Negroes
paid the same fare as white passengers. Furthermore,
while they have been arguing the constitutionality
of the suffrage laws of the South, white registrars have
been putting unfair tests to Negro applicants for registration,
and by so doing have made the laws a tool by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>which to work injustice to the Negro. While, finally, they
have been strenuously discussing the school laws, Negro
children have been suffering from, not only inadequate
but, in many cases, improper training by ignorant Negro
teachers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In suggesting the benefits that would accrue to the
weaker race from legalized race distinctions, it is assumed
that such distinctions would apply only in communities
in which two races live side by side in something like
equal numbers. The white people of the South should recognize
the inexpediency of requiring separate schools, separate
railroad and street cars, separate hotels, and separate
accommodations in general for the colored races in most
places outside the South where they constitute, in many
instances, not more than one-tenth of the total population.
The white people in the places last mentioned
should recognize that it would be equally unwise to crowd
together white and colored races in schools, public conveyances,
hotels, theatres, and other public places in the
South. Colored people everywhere should realize that a
race distinction is not necessarily a badge of racial inferiority,
but may be simply a natural result of racial
differentiation. Race distinctions may, therefore, have
a very appropriate place in communities where, as has
been said before, two races are about equal in numbers,
at least where there are enough of the subordinate race to
arouse in the dominant a feeling of race consciousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Where, under the above view, race distinctions are justifiable,
and are enacted into law, the people of all races
should unite in demanding that the laws be fairly applied.
If, for instance, the presence of sufficient Negroes make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>it advisable to separate the races in public conveyances,
the white people should unite with them in demanding
that they be given equal accommodations. The Negro
who has paid a first-class fare is entitled to coaches and
waiting-rooms as sanitary, comfortable, and convenient as
those provided for white persons paying the same fare.
With separate schools provided, they should insist that
each race be given an equal opportunity to get the sort of
training it most needs to do its work. This training may
be different. The Southern Education Association<a id='r776' /><a href='#f776' class='c014'><sup>[776]</sup></a> in
session at Lexington, Kentucky, said: “On account of
economic and psychological differences in the two races
we believe there should be a difference in the courses of
study and methods of teaching, and that there should be
such an adjustment of school curricula as shall meet the
evident needs of Negro youth.” If it is true that the
Negro child needs a different sort of training from the
white, then it is a discrimination to give him the training
peculiarly suited to the child of the other race. People
may demand for the two races equal educational opportunities,
and at the same time advocate different courses of
study and methods of teaching.</p>

<p class='c007'>In States which have added new qualifications for suffrage,
both races may demand their impartial application.
A Negro public spirited enough to pay his taxes, with education
enough to read and write, or thrifty enough to
accumulate the required amount of property should be
allowed to register and vote as freely as a white man with
similar qualifications. A white registrar who discriminates
against a Negro applicant, by setting for him more
difficult tests than are set for white applicants, is doing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>an injustice to the white people equally as great as that
done to the Negroes. John B. Knox,<a id='r777' /><a href='#f777' class='c014'><sup>[777]</sup></a> President of the
Alabama Constitutional Convention of 1901, said at that
time: “If we would have white supremacy, we must establish
it by law—not by force or fraud. If you teach
your boy that it is right to buy a vote, it is an easy step
for him to learn to use money to bribe or corrupt officials
or trustees of any class. If you teach your boy that it is
right to steal a vote, it is an easy step for him to believe
that it is right to steal whatever he may need or greatly
desire.” Speaking from the standpoint of the Negro, Dr.
Booker T. Washington<a id='r778' /><a href='#f778' class='c014'><sup>[778]</sup></a> said: “As a rule, I believe in universal,
free suffrage, but I believe that in the South we
are confronted with peculiar conditions that justify the
protection of the ballot in many of the States, for a while
at least, either by an educational test, a property test, or
by both combined; but whatever tests are required, they
should be made to apply with equal and exact justice to
both races.” All people, white and black, should unite,
not to secure the repeal of the suffrage laws, but to secure
their enforcement with absolute impartiality.</p>

<p class='c007'>The welfare of both races—and this conclusion applies
equally to the other non-Caucasian races—requires the
recognition of race distinctions and the obliteration of race
discriminations. The races should be separated wherever
race friction might result from their enforced association.
The white race cannot attain its highest development when
continually venting its spite upon the less fortunate race.
Nor, indeed, can the Negro race reach its highest development
when continually subjected to the oppressions of
the more fortunate race.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>Such a recognition of race distinctions and such an
obliteration of race discriminations as are here advocated
constitute principles by which all people, of every section
and of every race, may stand and labor for the promotion
of good feeling between all sections and harmony between
all races.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
